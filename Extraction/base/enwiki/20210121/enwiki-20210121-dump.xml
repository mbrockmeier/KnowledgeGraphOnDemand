The '''alkali metals''' consist of the [[chemical element]]s [[lithium]] (Li), [[sodium]] (Na), [[potassium]] (K),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The symbols '''Na''' and '''K''' for sodium and potassium are derived from their Latin names, ''natrium'' and ''kalium''; these are still the origins of the names for the elements in some languages, such as German and Russian.&lt;/ref&gt; [[rubidium]] (Rb), [[caesium]] (Cs),{{refn|''Caesium'' is the spelling recommended by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005|pages=248–49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) has used the spelling ''cesium'' since 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Anne M. |editor1-last= Coghill |editor2-first= Lorrin R. |editor2-last= Garson |year= 2006 |title= The ACS Style Guide: Effective Communication of Scientific Information |edition= 3rd |publisher= American Chemical Society |location= Washington, D.C. |isbn= 978-0-8412-3999-9 |page= [https://archive.org/details/acsstyleguideeff0000unse/page/127 127] |url= https://archive.org/details/acsstyleguideeff0000unse/page/127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pure Appl.

Together with [[hydrogen]] they constitute [[Group (periodic table)#Group names|group 1]],{{refn|In both the old IUPAC and the [[Chemical Abstracts Service|CAS]] systems for group numbering, this group is known as '''group IA''' (pronounced as "group one A", as the "I" is a [[Roman numeral]]).&lt;ref name = fluck&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluck |first1=E. |year=1988 |title=New Notations in the Periodic Table |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

All alkali metals have their outermost electron in an [[atomic orbital|s-orbital]]: this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties.{{refn|While hydrogen also has this electron configuration, it is not considered an alkali metal as it has very different behaviour owing to the lack of [[valence electron|valence]] p-orbitals in [[period&amp;nbsp;1 element]]s.|group=note}} Indeed, the alkali metals provide the best example of [[periodic trends|group trends]] in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised [[homology (chemistry)|homologous]] behaviour. This family of elements is also known as the '''lithium family''' after its leading element.

The alkali metals are all shiny, [[hardness|soft]], highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] metals at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and readily lose their [[valence electron|outermost electron]] to form [[cations]] with [[electric charge|charge]] +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to [[redox|oxidation]] by atmospheric moisture and [[oxygen]] (and in the case of lithium, [[nitrogen]]). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals.&lt;!--YES, NOT FRANCIUM. SEE BELOW.--&gt; All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in minute [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group; none was successful. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the [[second]]. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits light very efficiently. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an [[anode]] in [[lithium batteries]]. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolytes]], and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.

[[File:Petalite.jpg|thumb|alt=A sample of petalite|[[Petalite]], the lithium mineral from which lithium was first isolated]]
Sodium compounds have been known since ancient times; salt ([[sodium chloride]]) has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word ''salary'', referring to ''salarium'', money paid to Roman soldiers for the purchase of salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|salary}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2020}} While [[potash]] has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. [[Georg Ernst Stahl]] obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702,&lt;ref name="1702Suspect"&gt;{{cite book|language = de |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b-ATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 |page= 167|title= Chymische Schriften|last1= Marggraf|first= Andreas Siegmund |year= 1761}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau]] was able to prove this difference in 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3533j/f73.image.r=Memoires%20de%20l%27Academie%20royale%20des%20Sciences.langEN |journal= Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title= Sur la Base de Sel Marine |last= du Monceau|first= H.

Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by [[Humphry Davy]], who derived it from [[Potassium hydroxide|caustic potash]] (KOH, potassium hydroxide) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented [[voltaic pile]].

Around 1865 [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]] produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the [[octave]]s of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= On Relations Among the Equivalents |last=Newlands|first=John A.

His table placed hydrogen with the [[halogen]]s.&lt;ref name="meta-synthesis2" /&gt;

After 1869, [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and thallium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mendelejew |first=Dimitri |year=1869 |title=Über die Beziehungen der Eigenschaften zu den Atomgewichten der Elemente |journal=Zeitschrift für Chemie |pages=405–406 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, Mendeleev revised his table, placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium, and also moving thallium to the [[boron group]]. In this 1871 version, copper, silver, and [[gold]] were placed twice, once as part of [[group 11 element|group IB]], and once as part of a "group VIII" encompassing today's groups [[group 8 element|8]] to 11.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jensen |first1=William B. |year=2003 |title=The Place of Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury in the Periodic Table |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=8 |pages=952–961 |publisher=[[American Chemical Society]] |doi=10.1021/ed080p952 |bibcode=2003JChEd..80..952J |url=http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/091.%20Zn-Cd-Hg.pdf |access-date=2012-05-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611152417/http://www.che.uc.edu/jensen/W.%20B.%20Jensen/Reprints/091.%20Zn-Cd-Hg.pdf |archive-date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;In the 1869 version of Mendeleev's periodic table, copper and silver were placed in their own group, aligned with hydrogen and [[mercury (element)|mercury]], while gold was tentatively placed under [[uranium]] and the undiscovered [[gallium|eka-aluminium]] in the [[boron group]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of the 18-column table, the group IB elements were moved to their current position in the [[d-block]], while alkali metals were left in ''group IA''. Later the group's name was changed to ''group 1'' in 1988.&lt;ref name = fluck/&gt; The [[trivial name]] "alkali metals" comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong [[alkali]]s when dissolved in water.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the [[alpha decay]] of actinium-227.&lt;ref name="chemeducator"&gt;Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B.

== Occurrence ==

=== In the Solar System ===
[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|right|800px|Estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the [[Big Bang]]. The next three elements (lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) are rare because they are poorly synthesised in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.&lt;ref name=lodders&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lodders |first1= Katharina |year= 2003 |title= Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements |journal= The Astrophysical Journal |volume= 591 |issue= 2 |pages= 1220–1247 |bibcode= 2003ApJ...591.1220L |doi= 10.1086/375492|doi-access= free }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Oddo–Harkins rule]] holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number. In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.&lt;ref name=oddo&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/zaac.19140870118 |title= Die Molekularstruktur der radioaktiven Atome |year= 1914 |last1= Oddo |first1= Giuseppe |journal= Zeitschrift für Anorganische Chemie |volume= 87 |pages= 253–268|url= https://www.academia.edu/11043300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harkins&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ja02250a002 |year= 1917 |last1= Harkins |first1= William D. |journal= Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume= 39 |issue= 5 |pages= 856–879 |title= The Evolution of the Elements and the Stability of Complex Atoms.

The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in [[supernova]]e and not in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 [[nucleon]]s, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the [[triple-alpha process]], fusing three helium nuclei to form [[carbon]], and skipping over those three elements.&lt;ref name=lodders /&gt;

=== On Earth ===
[[File:Spodumene-usa59abg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spodumene]], an important lithium mineral]]
The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[planetary differentiation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgan|first1=J.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophiles]] and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with [[oxygen]] and so associate strongly with [[silica]], forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also [[incompatible element]]s due to their large [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].&lt;ref name="albarede"&gt;{{cite book |title= Geochemistry: an introduction |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=doVGzreGq14C&amp;pg=PA17 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2003 |isbn= 978-0-521-89148-6 |first= Francis |last= Albarède}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element.&lt;ref name="RubberBible86th" /&gt; Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include [[Halite (mineral)|halite]], [[amphibole]], [[cryolite]], [[nitratine]], and [[zeolite]].&lt;ref name="RubberBible86th" /&gt; Many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating, which still occurs now in places such as [[Utah]]'s [[Great Salt Lake]] and the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Despite their near-equal abundance in Earth's crust, sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean, both because potassium's larger size makes its salts less soluble, and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|69}}

Despite its chemical similarity, lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|69}} Due to its relatively low reactivity, it can be found in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ioes.saga-u.ac.jp/ioes-study/li/lithium/occurence.html |title=Lithium Occurrence |access-date=13 March 2009 |publisher=Institute of Ocean Energy, Saga University, Japan |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502142924/http://www.ioes.saga-u.ac.jp/ioes-study/li/lithium/occurence.html |archive-date=2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=enc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enclabs.com/lithium.html|access-date=15 October 2010|title=Some Facts about Lithium|publisher=ENC Labs}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 25 [[micromolar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/3-540-13534-0_3|chapter=Extraction of metals from sea water|volume= 124/1984|pages= 91–133|last=Schwochau|first=Klaus|year=1984|series=Topics in Current Chemistry|isbn=978-3-540-13534-0|title=Inorganic Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in [[ferromagnesium]] minerals, where its crustal concentration is about 18&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]], comparable to that of [[gallium]] and [[niobium]].

== Properties ==

=== Physical and chemical ===
The physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; valence [[electron configuration]], which results in weak [[metallic bonding]]. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low [[density|densities]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; [[melting point|melting]]&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[boiling point]]s,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; as well as [[heat of sublimation|heats of sublimation]], [[heat of vaporization|vaporisation]], and [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|74}} They all crystallise in the [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure,&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|73}} and have distinctive [[flame test|flame colours]] because their outer s electron is very easily excited.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|75}} The ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]], as well as very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|75}} Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|76}} Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.&lt;ref name=RubberBible84th /&gt;

The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other [[group (periodic table)|group]] are to each other.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Indeed, the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar [[ionic radius|ionic radii]]; lithium and sodium are more distinct.

In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions form [[metal ions in aqueous solution|aqua ions]] of the formula [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the solvation number. Their [[coordination number]]s and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the [[first coordination sphere]], also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a [[dative covalent bond]], with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by [[hydrogen bond]]s to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to [[Polarizability|polarise]] the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=John |title=Metal Ions in Solution |year=1978 |publisher=Ellis Horwood |location=Chichester |page=20 |isbn=978-0-85312-027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richens /&gt;{{rp|25}} The solvation number for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact [[ion pair]]s, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an [[octahedron|octahedral]] hexaaqua ion.

==== Lithium ====
The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation [[chemical polarity|polarises]] [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]] due to their similar atomic radii,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable [[nitride]], a property common among all the [[alkaline earth metal]]s (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals.&lt;ref name="alkalireact" /&gt; In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form [[organometallic compound]]s with significant covalent character (e.g. Li[[methyl group|Me]] and MgMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="Shriver&amp;Atkins"&gt;{{cite book |title=Inorganic Chemistry |first1=Duward |last1=Shriver |first2=Peter |last2=Atkins |publisher=W.

Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Conversely, [[lithium perchlorate]] and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a high [[solvation energy]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|76}} This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely [[hygroscopic]]: this allows salts like [[lithium chloride]] and [[lithium bromide]] to be used in [[dehumidifier]]s and [[air-conditioner]]s.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

==== Francium ====
Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high [[atomic weight]], causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] and [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its [[atomic radius]] is expected to be abnormally low.&lt;!--Haire says this happens for Uue because of the analogous effect for 8s – seems likely for Fr too--&gt; Thus, contrary to expectation, caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals, not francium.&lt;ref name="andreev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Uue"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements |editor1-last= Morss|editor2-first= Norman M. |editor2-last= Edelstein |editor3-last= Fuger|editor3-first= Jean |last1= Hoffman|first1= Darleane C. |last2=Lee|first2=Diana M. |last3=Pershina|first3=Valeria |chapter= Transactinides and the future elements |publisher= Springer |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-1-4020-3555-5 |location= Dordrecht, The Netherlands |edition= 3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1729}}&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt; All known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium, such as the first ionisation energy, electron affinity, and anion polarisability, though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values, ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium.&lt;ref name=Thayer /&gt; Some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity (47.2 kJ/mol)&lt;ref name=Landaualkalis&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Landau |first1= A. |last2= Eliav |first2= E. |last3= Ishikawa |first3= Y. |last4= Kaldor |first4= U. |year= 2001 |title= Benchmark calculations of electron affinities of the alkali atoms sodium to eka-francium (element 119) |url= https://www.academia.edu/20466410|journal= J.

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either [[odd–odd nuclei|odd–odd]] (both proton and [[neutron number]] are odd) or [[odd–even nuclei|odd–even]] ([[proton number]] is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd–odd nuclei have even [[mass number]]s, whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd–odd [[primordial nuclide]]s are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even–even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name="Lide02"&gt;{{cite book |author=Various authors|editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. |year=2002 |title=Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics |edition=88th |publisher=CRC |url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/ |access-date=2008-05-23 |isbn=978-0-8493-0486-6 |oclc=179976746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived [[radioisotope]] potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable nuclide]], since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobars]]) free to [[beta decay]] toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 [[monoisotopic element]]s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. [[Beryllium]] is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.&lt;ref name="Lide02" /&gt;

[[Caesium-137]], with a half-life of 30.17&amp;nbsp;years, is one of the two principal [[medium-lived fission product]]s, along with [[strontium-90]], which are responsible for most of the [[radioactivity]] of [[spent nuclear fuel]] after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the [[Chernobyl accident]]. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable [[barium-137]]. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay.&lt;ref name="Cs-137"&gt;{{cite web |title=Radionuclide Half-Life Measurements|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/data/halflife-html.cfm|author=National Institute of Standards and Technology|access-date=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caesium-137 has been used as a [[Flow tracer|tracer]] in hydrologic studies, analogous to the use of [[tritium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160329120038/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/isotopes/cesium.asp Radioisotope Brief: Cesium-137 (Cs-137)].

== Periodic trends ==
The alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other [[group (periodic table)|group]] are to each other.&lt;ref name=rsc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/PAGES/data/intro_groupi_data.html |title=Visual Elements: Group 1 – The Alkali Metals |author=Royal Society of Chemistry |work=Visual Elements |publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry |access-date=13 January 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805145647/http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/PAGES/data/intro_groupi_data.html |archive-date=5 August 2012 |author-link=Royal Society of Chemistry }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing [[atomic radius]],&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; decreasing [[electronegativity]],&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; increasing [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and decreasing melting and boiling points&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}} In general, their [[density|densities]] increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

=== Atomic and ionic radii ===
{{Main|Atomic radius}}
[[File:Effective Nuclear Charge.svg|thumb|250px|[[Effective nuclear charge]] on an atomic electron]]
The atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; Because of the [[shielding effect]], when an atom has more than one [[electron shell]], each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus.&lt;ref name=shielding&gt;{{cite book |first1=Theodore |last1=L. Brown |first2=H. Eugene |last2=LeMay, Jr. |first3=Bruce E. |last3=Bursten |first4=Julia R. |last4=Burdge |year=2003 |title=Chemistry: The Central Science |edition=8th |publisher=Pearson Education |location=US |isbn=978-0-13-061142-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the alkali metals, the [[valence electron|outermost electron]] only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the [[nuclear charge]] (which is equal to the [[atomic number]]) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

The [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller. Additionally, the [[effective nuclear charge]] has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== First ionisation energy ===
{{Main|Ionisation energy}}
[[File:First Ionization Energy.svg|thumb|350px|right|Periodic trend for ionisation energy: each period begins at a minimum for the alkali metals, and ends at a maximum for the [[noble gas]]es.]]
The first ionisation energy of an [[chemical element|element]] or [[molecule]] is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with [[electric charge]] +1. The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the [[nuclear charge]], the amount of [[shielding effect|shielding]] by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus, which is always an outer electron in [[main group element]]s. The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels. Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations. This makes francium's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus, increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium.)&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{Rp|1729}}&lt;!--Also explain why the alkali metals have the lowest ionization energies in their period.--&gt;

The second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled [[electron shell]] and is thus difficult to remove.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== Reactivity ===
{{Main|Reactivity (chemistry)}}
The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group. This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.&lt;ref name="alkaliwater"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |access-date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electronegativity ===
{{Main|Electronegativity}}
[[File:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|300px|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the [[main group element|main groups]] of the periodic table from the [[period 2 element|second]] to the [[period 6 element|sixth period]]]]
Electronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.&lt;ref name="definition"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an [[ionic bond]]). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

Because of the higher electronegativity of lithium, some of its compounds have a more covalent character. For example, [[lithium iodide]] ([[lithium|Li]] [[iodine|I]]) will dissolve in [[organic solvent]]s, a property of most covalent compounds.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; [[Lithium fluoride]] (Li[[fluorine|F]]) is the only [[alkali halide]] that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] (Li[[hydroxide|OH]]) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;

=== Melting and boiling points ===
{{Main|Melting point|Boiling point}}
The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes [[state of matter|state]] from [[solid]] to [[liquid]] while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the [[vapor pressure|vapour pressure]] of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldberg|first=David E. |title=3,000 Solved Problems in Chemistry|edition=1st|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1988|isbn=978-0-07-023684-4}} Section 17.43, page 321&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Theodore, Louis |editor2=Dupont, R. Ryan |editor3=Ganesan, Kumar |title=Pollution Prevention: The Waste Management Approach to the 21st Century|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-56670-495-3|page=15 Section 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all the liquid changes state to [[gas]]. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the [[metallic bond]]s keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;&lt;ref name="metallic-bonding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/metallic.html |title=Metallic Bonding |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2000 |work=chemguide |access-date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; This is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;&lt;ref name="metallic-bonding" /&gt; As the atoms increase in size going down the group (because their atomic radius increases), the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil, thus lowering the melting and boiling points.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; (The increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect.)&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt;

=== Density ===
{{Main|Density}}
The alkali metals all have the same [[crystal structure]] ([[body-centered cubic|body-centred cubic]])&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt; and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms, since density is defined as mass per unit volume. The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.&lt;ref name=chemguide /&gt; Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water:&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at [[room temperature]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|75}}

== Compounds ==
The alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends. These compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|79}} This description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase, and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable. For instance, [[ionic bond]]ing gives way to [[metallic bond]]ing along the series NaCl, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;As, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sb, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi, Na.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

=== Hydroxides ===

}}
[[File:Large Sodium Explosion.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large orange-yellow explosion|A reaction of 3 [[pound (mass)|pounds]] (≈ 1.4&amp;nbsp;kg) of sodium with water]]
All the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water, producing an [[aqueous solution]] of a strongly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] alkali metal [[hydroxide]] and releasing hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="alkaliwater" /&gt; This reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group: lithium reacts steadily with [[effervescence]], but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, of which there are two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).&lt;ref name="alkalibangs" /&gt; The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|87}}

Recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a [[Coulomb explosion]] rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself.&lt;ref name=coulomb&gt;{{cite journal |title=Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water|journal=Nature Chemistry|doi=10.1038/nchem.2161|pmid = 25698335|date=26 January 2015|volume=7|issue=3|pages=250–254|bibcode=2015NatCh...7..250M | last1 = Mason | first1 = Philip E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water. Water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal, leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions. The attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area, causing an exponential increase of ionisation. When the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension, it vigorously explodes.&lt;ref name=coulomb /&gt;

The hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give [[oligomer]]ic [[alkoxide]]s. They easily react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form [[carbonate]]s or [[bicarbonate]]s, or with [[hydrogen sulfide]] to form [[sulfide]]s or [[bisulfide]]s, and may be used to separate [[thiol]]s from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of [[aluminium]], [[zinc]], [[tin]], and [[lead]] react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. [[Silicon dioxide]] is acidic, and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack [[silicate glass]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|87}}

=== Intermetallic compounds ===
[[File:NaK alloy.jpg|thumb|right|Liquid NaK alloy at room temperature]]
The alkali metals form many [[intermetallic compound]]s with each other and the elements from groups [[alkaline earth metal|2]] to [[boron group|13]] in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries,&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|81}} such as the [[sodium amalgam]]s with [[mercury (element)|mercury]], including Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Hg&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Hg.&lt;ref&gt;Buszek, Keith R.

=== Compounds with the group 13 elements ===
The intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements ([[aluminium]], [[gallium]], [[indium]], and [[thallium]]), such as NaTl, are poor [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] or [[semiconductor]]s, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the [[Zintl phase|Zintl anions]] involved.&lt;ref name="Sevov"&gt;Sevov, S.C. [http://www3.nd.edu/~sevovlab/articles/SlaviChapter.pdf "Zintl Phases"], pp. 113–132 in ''Intermetallic Compounds, Principles and Practice: Progress'', Vol. 3. Westbrook, J.H.; Freisher, R.L.: Eds.; John Wiley &amp; Sons. Ltd., Chichester, England {{DOI|10.1002/0470845856}} {{ISBN|978-0-470-84585-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;—)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; with a covalent [[diamond cubic]] structure with Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.&lt;ref name="Kauzlarich"&gt;S.M. Kauzlarich, Encyclopedia of Inorganic chemistry, 1994, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-93620-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boron]] is a special case, being the only nonmetal in group 13. The alkali metal [[boride]]s tend to be boron-rich, involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving [[deltahedron|deltahedral]] structures,&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|147–8}} and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high [[vapour pressure]] at elevated temperatures. This makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below 700&amp;nbsp;°C, and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess. Furthermore, exceptionally in this group, reactivity with boron decreases down the group: lithium reacts completely at 700&amp;nbsp;°C, but sodium at 900&amp;nbsp;°C and potassium not until 1200&amp;nbsp;°C, and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium. Rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised.

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.&lt;ref name="alkalireact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |access-date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium nitride]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=Jansen1&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|last1=Fischer|first1=D. |last2=Jansen|first2=M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|pages=1755–1756|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10&lt;1755::AID-ANIE1755&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jansen2"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and structure of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|last1=Fischer|first1=D. |last2=Cancarevic|first2=Z. |last3=Schön|first3=J.

All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).&lt;ref name="alkalireact" /&gt;

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name="alkalireact" /&gt; In addition, the small size of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidising agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

For example, sodium can react with sulfur to form the [[sulfide]] ([[sodium sulfide|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]) and various [[polysulfide]]s with the formula Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'' from 2 to 6), containing the {{chem|S|''x''|2-}} ions.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Due to the basicity of the Se&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; and Te&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the alkali metal [[selenide]]s and [[telluride (chemistry)|tellurides]] are alkaline in solution; when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium, alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the {{chem|Se|''x''|2-}} and {{chem|Te|''x''|2-}} ions.&lt;ref name="house2008"&gt;{{cite book |title= Inorganic chemistry |first= James E.|last= House |publisher= Academic Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-12-356786-4 |page= 524}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present, and are colourless, water-soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|766}} The alkali metal [[polonide]]s are all ionic compounds containing the Po&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion; they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around 300–400&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|766}}&lt;ref name="AEC-chem"&gt;{{cite book |last= Moyer |first= Harvey V. |contribution= Chemical Properties of Polonium |pages= 33–96 |title= Polonium |url= http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/4367751-nEJIbm/ |editor-last= Moyer |editor-first= Harvey V. |id= TID-5221 |doi= 10.2172/4367751 |year= 1956 |location= Oak Ridge, Tenn. |publisher= United States Atomic Energy Commission }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bagnall"&gt;{{cite journal |first= K.

=== Halides, hydrides, and pseudohalides ===
{{Main|Alkali metal halide}}
The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s ([[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], [[iodine]], and [[astatine]]), forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|76}} All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;&lt;ref name="alkalireact" /&gt; All the alkali metal halides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water except for [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high [[lattice enthalpy]]. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, causing the [[electrostatic interaction]]s between them to be strong:&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; a similar effect occurs for [[magnesium fluoride]], consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|76}}

The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the [[hydride]] anion acts as a [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalide]]: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|83}}&lt;ref name="generalchemistry"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |title=Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications with Student Access Kit for Mastering General Chemistry |chapter-url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_25_03.html |access-date=24 June 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=1st |isbn=978-0-8053-3799-0 |chapter=21.3: The Alkali Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the [[cyanide]]s. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for [[lithium cyanide]], indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|322}} Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ClO, K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;BrO (yellow), Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, are also known.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|83}} The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|835}}

Alkali metal cations do not usually form [[coordination complex]]es with simple [[Lewis base]]s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes).&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|90}} Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits [[coordination number]]s from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|90–1}} In [[aqueous solution]], the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, [[anhydrous]] salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as [[desiccant]]s.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Alkali metals also readily form complexes with [[crown ether]]s (e.g. [[12-crown-4]] for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[15-crown-5]] for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[18-crown-6]] for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[21-crown-7]] for Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[cryptand]]s due to electrostatic attraction.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

=== Ammonia solutions ===
The alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid [[ammonia]], forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and [[solvated electron]] e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, which react to form hydrogen gas and the [[metal amide#Alkali metal amides|alkali metal amide]] (MNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a [[catalyst]]. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent [[alkaline earth metal]]s [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], as well as the divalent [[lanthanide]]s, [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause&lt;!--don't link; the one being referred to has no article on WP yet--&gt; identified the colour as being due to the presence of [[solvated electron]]s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous [[sodium chloride]]; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;w"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cotton |first1=F. A. |first2=G.|last2=Wilkinson |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |isbn=978-0-471-17560-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] alkali metal molecules (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and alkali metal anions (M&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful [[reducing agent]]s and are often used in chemical synthesis.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable [[organometallic compound]]s, which are bonded covalently. [[Organolithium reagent|Organolithium]] compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form [[oligomer]]s with the structure (RLi)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the [[charge density]] of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a [[carbanion]], organolithium compounds are extremely powerful [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and [[carbon nucleophile|nucleophiles]]. For use as bases, [[butyllithium]]s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is [[methyllithium]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), which exists in tetrameric (''x'' = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (''x'' = 6, octahedral) forms.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1957&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown|first1=T.

The reaction with [[nickel tetracarbonyl]], for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes [[electrophilic substitution]] to give the desired aldehyde (using H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|105}}

Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with ''N'',''N''-disubstituted [[amide]]s to give aldehydes and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with [[carbon monoxide]]. They thermally decompose to eliminate a β-hydrogen, producing [[alkene]]s and [[lithium hydride]]: another route is the reaction of [[ether]]s with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|105}} In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic [[carboxylic acid]]s (ArCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C(Ar)OH). Finally, they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|106}}

==== Heavier alkali metals ====
Unlike the organolithium compounds, the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of [[organosodium chemistry|organosodium]] compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from [[organolithium compound]]s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]]. [[Sodium tetraphenylborate]] can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is [[Schlosser's base]], a mixture of [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide|potassium ''tert''-butoxide]]. This reagent reacts with [[propene]] to form the compound [[allylpotassium]] (KCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[cis-2-butene|''cis''-2-Butene]] and [[trans-2-butene|''trans''-2-butene]] equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas [[isomerisation]] is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the [[steric hindrance|sterically]] congested conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Superbases for organic synthesis |last=Schlosser|first=Manfred|journal= Pure Appl. Chem. |volume= 60 |issue= 11 |pages= 1627–1634 |year= 1988 |doi= 10.1351/pac198860111627|s2cid=39746336|url= http://old.iupac.org/publications/pac/1988/pdf/6011x1627.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric.&lt;ref name=Klett&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ejic.201000983|title=Synthesis and Structures of \(Trimethylsilyl)methyl]sodium and -potassium with Bi- and Tridentate N-Donor Ligands|year=2011|last1=Clegg|first1=William|last2=Conway|first2=Ben|last3=Kennedy|first3=Alan R.|last4=Klett|first4=Jan|last5=Mulvey|first5=Robert E.|last6=Russo|first6=Luca|journal=European Journal of Inorganic Chemistry|volume=2011|issue=5|pages=721–726|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/210286264|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt;

Alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air. They cause the cleavage of [[ether]]s, generating alkoxides. Unlike alkyllithium compounds, alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because [[Wurtz coupling]] occurs:&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}}
:RM + R'X → R–R' + MX

As such, they have to be made by reacting [[organomercury compound|alkylmercury]] compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents. While methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium, methylpotassium is more ionic and has the [[nickel arsenide]] structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}}

The alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example [[cyclopentadiene]]s and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, the most common of which being [[tetrahydrofuran]]. The most important of these compounds is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]], NaC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|265}} Similarly, the alkali metals react with [[cyclooctatetraene]] in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal [[cyclooctatetraenide]]s; for example, [[dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as [[uranocene]].&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|266}} The large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green [[sodium naphthalenide]], Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;•]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, a strong reducing agent.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|266}}

The alkali metal peroxides are ionic compounds that are unstable in water. The peroxide anion is weakly bound to the cation, and it is hydrolysed, forming stronger covalent bonds.

With sulphur, they form sulphides and polysulphides.&lt;ref&gt;"The chemistry of the Elements" by Greenwood and Earnshaw, 2nd edition, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

Because alkali metal sulphides are essentially salts of a weak acid and a strong base, they form basic solutions.

Lithium is the only metal that combines directly with nitrogen at room temperature.

:Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 3LiOH + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

'''''Reaction with hydrogen'''''

With hydrogen, alkali metals form saline hydrides that hydrolyse in water. 
:Na + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NaH (at high temperatures)

'''''Reaction with carbon'''''

Lithium is the only metal that reacts directly with carbon to give dilithium acetylide. Na and K can react with [[acetylene]] to give acetylides.&lt;ref&gt;"Inorganic Chemistry" by Cotton and Wilkinson&lt;/ref&gt;
:2Li + 2C → Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:Na + NaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (at 220&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C)

'''''Reaction with water'''''

On reaction with water, they generate hydroxide ions and [[hydrogen]] gas. This reaction is vigorous and highly exothermic and the hydrogen resulted may ignite in air or even explode in the case of Rb and Cs.&lt;ref name="miessler"/&gt;
:Na + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → NaOH + 1/2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

'''''Reaction with other salts'''''

The alkali metals are very good reducing agents. They can reduce metal cations that are less electropositive. [[Titanium]] is produced industrially by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride with Na at 400&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C ([[van Arkel process]]).
:TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 4Na → 4NaCl + Ti

'''''Reaction with organohalide compounds'''''

Alkali metals react with halogen derivatives to generate hydrocarbon via the [[Wurtz reaction]].
:2CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Cl + 2Na → H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2NaCl

'''''Alkali metals in liquid ammonia'''''

Alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia or other donor solvents like aliphatic amines or hexamethylphosphoramide to give blue solutions. These solutions are believed to contain free electrons.&lt;ref name="miessler"/&gt;
:Na + xNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Due to the presence of [[solvated electrons]], these solutions are very powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis.

Other reductions&lt;ref name="miessler"/&gt; that can be carried by these solutions are:

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first [[period 8 element]], the undiscovered element [[ununennium]] (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]]; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; or rubidium&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]], ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]];&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; this effect is already seen for francium.&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.&lt;ref name="tanm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf |title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |last=Gäggeler |first=Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&amp;M |access-date=26 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220090755/http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA%26M/TexasA%26M.pdf |archive-date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's [[electron affinity]] far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it.

The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]],&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} very close to that of rubidium (247&amp;nbsp;pm),&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 [[oxidation state]],&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} which is not seen in any other alkali metal,&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|28}} in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name="Uue" /&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large [[covalent]] character, due to the involvement of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons in the bonding.&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thayer |first1=John S. |title=Relativistic Effects and the Chemistry of the Heavier Main Group Elements |year=2010 |pages=81, 84 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9975-5_2 |journal=Relativistic Methods for Chemists|volume=10 |isbn=978-1-4020-9974-8 |series=Challenges and Advances in Computational Chemistry and Physics }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pseudo-alkali metals ==
Many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations. Analogously to the [[pseudohalogen]]s, they have sometimes been called "pseudo-alkali metals". These substances include some elements and many more [[polyatomic ion]]s; the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power.&lt;ref name=pseudo /&gt;

=== Hydrogen ===
The element [[hydrogen]], with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal;&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; when it is considered to be an alkali metal, it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties.&lt;ref name="Folden"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclotron.tamu.edu/smp/The%20Heaviest%20Elements%20in%20the%20Universe.pdf |title=The Heaviest Elements in the Universe |last=Folden|first=Cody |date=31 January 2009 |work=Saturday Morning Physics at Texas A&amp;M |access-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810213232/http://cyclotron.tamu.edu/smp/The%20Heaviest%20Elements%20in%20the%20Universe.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a [[diatomic]] gas consisting of two atoms per [[molecule]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emsley|first=J. |title= The Elements |publisher= Oxford: Clarendon Press |year= 1989 |pages= 22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--It is uncertain if this reference (from [[diatomic molecule]]) refers to astatine usually not being considered with the other halogens or the list of elements that form diatomic molecules.--&gt; however, the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules (such as [[dilithium]], Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) at high temperatures, when they are in the [[gas]]eous state.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, Mark J.

Hydrogen, like the alkali metals, has one [[valence electron]]&lt;ref name=King/&gt; and reacts easily with the [[halogen]]s,&lt;ref name=King/&gt; but the similarities end there because of the small size of a bare proton H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; compared to the alkali metal cations.&lt;ref name=King/&gt; Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its [[electron configuration]].&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.iupac.org/reports/periodic_table/ |title=International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry &gt; Periodic Table of the Elements |publisher=IUPAC |access-date=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes placed above [[carbon]] due to their similar electronegativities&lt;ref name="hydrogen" /&gt; or [[fluorine]] due to their similar chemical properties.&lt;ref name="hydrogen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronyn |first=Marshall W. |title=The Proper Place for Hydrogen in the Periodic Table |journal=Journal of Chemical Education |volume=80 |issue=8 |date=August 2003 |pages=947–951 |doi=10.1021/ed080p947 |url=http://www.reed.edu/reed_magazine/summer2009/columns/noaa/downloads/CronynHydrogen.pdf |bibcode=2003JChEd..80..947C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ionisation energy of hydrogen (1312.0 [[kilojoule per mole|kJ/mol]]) is much higher than that of the alkali metals.&lt;ref name="huheey"&gt;Huheey, J.E.; Keiter, E.A. and Keiter, R.L.

The 1s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration of hydrogen, while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals (ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;), is unique because there is no 1p subshell.

Other "pseudo-alkali metals" include the [[alkylammonium]] cations, in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. In particular, the [[quaternary ammonium cation]]s ({{chem|NR|4|+}}) are very useful since they are permanently charged, and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as {{chem|HI|2|-}}.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|812–9}} Tetraalkylammonium hydroxides, like alkali metal hydroxides, are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|256}} Furthermore, the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony atom (the heavier nonmetallic [[pnictogen]]s), creating a [[phosphonium]] ({{chem|PH|4|+}}) or [[arsonium]] ({{chem|AsH|4|+}}) cation that can itself be substituted similarly; while [[stibonium]] ({{chem|SbH|4|+}}) itself is not known, some of its organic derivatives are characterised.&lt;ref name=pseudo /&gt;

=== Cobaltocene and derivatives ===
[[Cobaltocene]], Co(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a [[metallocene]], the [[cobalt]] analogue of [[ferrocene]]. It is a dark purple solid. Cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons, one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes, such as its very stable relative, ferrocene, in accordance with the [[18-electron rule]]. This additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the Co–C bonds. Consequently, many chemical reactions of Co(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are characterized by its tendency to lose this "extra" electron, yielding a very stable 18-electron cation known as cobaltocenium. Many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts, and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate.&lt;ref name=King /&gt;{{rp|256}} Like the alkali metals, cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent, and [[decamethylcobaltocene]] is stronger still due to the combined [[inductive effect]] of the ten methyl groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cr940053x|pmid=11848774|title=Chemical Redox Agents for Organometallic Chemistry|journal=Chemical Reviews|volume=96|issue=2|pages=877–910|year=1996|last1=Connelly|first1=Neil G.|last2=Geiger|first2=William E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener [[rhodium]] to give [[rhodocene]], an even stronger reducing agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= El Murr |first1= N. |last2= Sheats |first2= J.

[[Thallium]] is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At the bottom of the periodic table, the [[inert pair effect]] is quite strong, because of the [[relativistic effects|relativistic]] stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|226–7}} It displays the +1 [[oxidation state]]&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|28}} that all the known alkali metals display,&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|28}} and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 [[oxidation state]] closely resemble the corresponding potassium or [[silver]] compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (164&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]]), K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (152&amp;nbsp;pm) and Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (129&amp;nbsp;pm) ions.&lt;ref name=Shannon&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1107/S0567739476001551|title=Revised effective ionic radii and systematic studies of interatomic distances in halides and chalcogenides|last=Shannon|first=R.

The [[group 11 element|group 11 metals]] (or coinage metals), [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[gold]], are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with [[post-transition metal]]s. "The filled ''d'' subshell and free ''s'' electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between ''s'' electrons and the partially filled ''d'' subshell that lower electron mobility."&lt;ref&gt;Russell AM &amp; Lee KL (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC ''Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals'']. Wiley-Interscience, New York. p.&amp;nbsp;302. {{ISBN|0-471-64952-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is one reason for their previously being labelled as "group IB", paralleling the alkali metals' "group IA". They are occasionally classified as post-transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;Deming HG (1940) ''Fundamental Chemistry,'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;705–7&lt;/ref&gt; Their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; Their monopositive ions are [[paramagnetic]] and contribute no colour to their salts, like those of the alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;Bailar, J. C. (1973) ''Comprehensive inorganic chemistry'', vol. 3, p. 16. {{ISBN|1-57215-291-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table, copper, silver, and gold are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the [[iron triad]] and [[platinum group metal]]s), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of copper(II) and gold(III) compounds being known at that time.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt; Soon afterward, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen /&gt;

The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; group 11: d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the similarities are largely confined to the [[stochiometry|stoichiometries]] of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}} This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid [[ammonia]], as well as having more covalent character in their compounds.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the [[electrochemical series]], whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}} The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear [[transition metal]] character.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}} Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]] because its 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|1177}}

The production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water.&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; From their [[silicate]] ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: [[sulfuric acid]] is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and [[aluminium]](III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the [[aluminium hydroxide|hydroxide]]. The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]] to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry /&gt; Most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity; one of the few which does not is the [[pyrolysis]] of the corresponding alkali metal [[azide]], which yields the metal for sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium and the nitride for lithium.&lt;ref name=King/&gt;{{rp|77}}

Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]].&lt;ref name="ober"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |title=Lithium|access-date= 19 August 2007|last=Ober |first=Joyce A. |pages= 77–78 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070711062102/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450798.pdf |archive-date= 11 July 2007  |url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried [[seabed]],&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; but is now produced through [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium chloride]] by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700&amp;nbsp;°C through the use of a [[Downs cell]].&lt;ref name="pauling"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pauling |first=Linus |title= General Chemistry |edition=1970 |publisher=Dover Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="losal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|access-date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of [[sodium azide]].&lt;ref&gt;Merck Index, 9th ed., monograph 8325&lt;/ref&gt; Potassium occurs in many minerals, such as [[sylvite]] ([[potassium chloride]]).&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; Previously, potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of [[potassium chloride]] or [[potassium hydroxide]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Webelements|title=WebElements Periodic Table of the Elements {{pipe}} Potassium {{pipe}} Essential information |url=http://www.webelements.com/potassium/ |last=Winter|first=Mark|access-date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s.&lt;ref name=kirk&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|doi=10.1002/0471238961.1915040912051311.a01.pub2|chapter=Sodium and Sodium Alloys|title=Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|year=2001|last1=Lemke|first1=Charles H.|last2=Markant|first2=Vernon H.|isbn=978-0-471-23896-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be produced from [[seawater]].&lt;ref name=rsc /&gt; However, these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures, potentially forming the explosive superoxide.

Although sodium is less reactive than potassium, this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|74}}

== Applications ==
[[File:FOCS-1.jpg|thumb|right|alt=FOCS 1, a caesium atomic clock in Switzerland|FOCS 1, a caesium atomic clock in Switzerland]]
Lithium, sodium, and potassium have many applications, while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|68}} Lithium is often used in [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]], and [[lithium oxide]] can help process silica. [[Lithium stearate]] is a thickener and can be used to make lubricating greases; it is produced from lithium hydroxide, which is also used to absorb [[carbon dioxide]] in space capsules and submarines.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|70}} [[Lithium chloride]] is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=USGS |year=2011|title=Lithium|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2011-lithi.pdf|access-date=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys.&lt;ref name="Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw" /&gt;{{rp|70}}

Sodium compounds have many applications, the most well-known being sodium chloride as [[table salt]]. Sodium salts of [[fatty acid]]s are used as soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Soaps &amp; Detergents: Chemistry|url=http://www.cleaninginstitute.org/clean_living/soaps__detergents_chemistry.aspx|access-date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]], which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting,&lt;ref name="lamp1"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0d7u9Nr33zIC&amp;pg=PA112 |page= 112 |title= Applied illumination engineering |isbn= 978-0-88173-212-2 |last1=Lindsey|first1=Jack L |year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamp2"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AFNwNAFYtCAC&amp;pg=PA241 |page= 241 |title= Revolution in lamps: A chronicle of 50 years of progress |isbn= 978-0-88173-351-8 |last1=Kane|first1=Raymond |last2= Sell |first2= Heinz |year= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can help smooth the surface of other metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kyVWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=METALLIC+SODIUM+++DESCALING+SEVERAL |title= Metal treatment and drop forging |last1=Stampers|first1=National Association of Drop Forgers and|year= 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LI4KmKqca78C&amp;pg=PA76 |page= 76 |title= Metal cleaning bibliographical abstracts |last1=Harris|first1=Jay C |year= 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being a strong reducing agent, it is often used to reduce many other metals, such as [[titanium]] and [[zirconium]], from their chlorides.

== Biological role and precautions ==

=== Metals ===
Pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, [[halocarbon]]s, [[plastic]]s, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires.&lt;ref name=osu /&gt; Some Class D dry powder [[fire extinguisher|extinguishers]] designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2fHsoobsCNwC&amp;pg=PA459|page= 459 |title= Fire and Life Safety Inspection Manual |isbn= 978-0-87765-472-8|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |last= Solomon |first=Robert E. |date= 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a [[fume hood]]. Small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water, but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive [[isopropanol]].&lt;ref name=osu /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelici|first=R.

[[Radioisotope]]s of caesium require special precautions: the improper handling of caesium-137 [[gamma ray]] sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries. Perhaps the best-known case is the Goiânia accident of 1987, in which an improperly-disposed-of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of [[Goiânia]], [[Brazil]], was scavenged from a junkyard, and the glowing [[caesium chloride|caesium salt]] sold to curious, uneducated buyers. This led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure. Together with [[caesium-134]], [[iodine-131]], and [[strontium-90]], caesium-137 was among the isotopes distributed by the [[Chernobyl disaster]] which constitute the greatest risk to health.&lt;ref name="IAEA" /&gt; Radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half-life, but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk.&lt;ref name=andyscouse /&gt;

'''Advanced Chemistry''' is a [[German hip hop]] group from [[Heidelberg]], a scenic city in [[Baden-Württemberg]], South Germany. Advanced Chemistry was founded in 1987 by [[Toni L]], Linguist, Gee-One, DJ Mike MD (Mike Dippon) and [[Torch (rapper)|MC Torch]]. Each member of the group holds German citizenship, and Toni L, Linguist, and Torch are of Italian, Ghanaian, and Haitian backgrounds, respectively.&lt;ref name = "lqomwy"&gt;Pennay, Mark "Rap in Germinay" in Mitchell, Tony ed. Global Noise. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by North American socially [[conscious hip hop|conscious rap]] and the [[Native Tongues Posse|Native tongues movement]], Advanced Chemistry is regarded as one of the main pioneers in German hip hop. They were one of the first groups to rap in German (although their name is in English). Furthermore, their songs tackled controversial social and political issues, distinguishing them from early German hip hop group "[[Die Fantastischen Vier]]" (The Fantastic Four),  which had a more light-hearted, playful, party image.&lt;ref name = "lqomwy"/&gt;

==Career==
One of the first issues that confronts us{{Who|date=October 2009}} when we move outside the English-speaking market for recorded music is to establish whether or not the discrete musical genres we{{Who|date=October 2009}} know from that market are fully congruent with similar divisions in other pop worlds. This is important in two ways. First, although no single country comes close to matching the amounts spent on recorded music in the United States, these markets are nonetheless economically significant. Germany, for instance, is the largest single market in western Europe, with estimated annual sales of U.S. $3.74 billion in 1996. This represents around 30 percent of reported U.S. sales and makes Germany the third biggest music market in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Michell, Tony Global Noise (Rap and Hip-Hop outside the USA) Published by Wesleyan University Press, Middletown CT. 06549 (C)2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced Chemistry frequently rapped about their lives and experiences as children of immigrants,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; exposing the marginalization experienced by most ethnic minorities in Germany, and the feelings of frustration and resentment that being denied a German identity can cause.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Andy. "Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities." In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200. New York; London: Routledge, 2004, p. 183-184&lt;/ref&gt; The song "Fremd im eigenen Land" (Foreign in your own nation) was released by Advanced Chemistry in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://api.discogs.com/artists/61022|title=Advanced Chemistry|website=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single became a staple in the [[German hip hop]] scene. It made a strong statement about the status of immigrants throughout Germany, as the group was composed of multi-national and multi-racial members. The video shows several members brandishing their German passports as a demonstration of their German citizenship to skeptical and unaccepting 'ethnic' Germans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This idea of national identity is important, as many rap artists in Germany have been of foreign origin. These so-called ''Gastarbeiter'' (guest workers) children saw breakdance, graffiti, rap music, and hip hop culture as a means of expressing themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Johannes. ''Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German''&gt;Vol. 36, No. 1. (Spring, 2003) pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of "Fremd im eigenen Land", many other German-language rappers have also tried to confront anti-immigrant ideas and develop themes of citizenship. However, though many ethnic minority youth in Germany find  these German identity themes appealing, others view the desire of immigrants to be seen as German negatively, and they have actively sought to revive and recreate concepts of identity in connection to traditional ethnic origins.&lt;ref name="Bennett"/&gt;

Advanced Chemistry helped to found the German chapter of the Zulu nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://leaveyournineathome.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/german-hip-hop-1-advanced-chemistry/.  Accessed March 26. Last updated October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry between Advanced Chemistry and Die Fantastischen Vier has served to highlight a dichotomy in the routes that hip hop has taken in becoming a part of the German soundscape.  While Die Fantastischen Vier may be said to view hip hop primarily as an aesthetic art form,  Advanced Chemistry understand hip hop as being inextricably linked to the social and political circumstances under which it is created.  For Advanced Chemistry, hip hop is a “vehicle of general human emancipation,”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Brown, Timothy S. "'Keeping it Real' in a Different 'Hood:(African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany." In The Vinyl Ain'tFinal: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 137-50. London&lt;/ref&gt;  In their undertaking of social and political issues, the band introduced the term "Afro-German" into the context of German hip hop, and the theme of race is highlighted in much of their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://koelnischerkunstverein.de/startseite.htm|title=Kölnischer Kunstverein|website=koelnischerkunstverein.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the release of the single “Fremd im eigenen Land”, Advanced Chemistry separated itself from the rest of the rap being produced in Germany.  This single was the first of its kind to go beyond simply imitating US rap and addressed the current issues of the time. Fremd im eigenen Land which translates to “foreign in my own country” dealt with the widespread racism that non-white German citizens faced.  This change from simple imitation to political commentary was the start of German identification with rap.&lt;ref name="lqomwy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web |url=http://nomadicwax.com/2007/12/16/hip-hop-in-germany/ |title=Hip hop in Germany : Nomadic Wax&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=March 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080318224243/http://nomadicwax.com/2007/12/16/hip-hop-in-germany/ |archive-date=March 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }} 
&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of “Fremd im eigenen Land” was influenced by the 'wall of noise' created by Public Enemy's producers, The Bomb Squad.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Bomb Squad]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reunification of Germany, an abundance of anti-immigrant sentiment emerged, as well as attacks on the homes of refugees in the early 1990s.  Advanced Chemistry came to prominence in the wake of these actions because of their pro-multicultural society stance in their music.  Advanced Chemistry's attitudes revolve around their attempts to create a distinct "Germanness" in hip hop, as opposed to imitating American hip hop as other groups had done.  Torch has said, "What the Americans do is exotic for us because we don't live like they do.  What they do seems to be more interesting and newer. But not for me.  For me it's more exciting to experience my fellow Germans in new contexts...For me, it's interesting to see what the kids try to do that's different from what I know." &lt;ref&gt;Brown, Timothy S. “‘Keeping it Real’ in a Different ‘Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, 137-50. London; A&lt;/ref&gt;  Advanced Chemistry were the first to use the term "Afro-German" in a hip hop context.  This was part of the pro-immigrant political message they sent via their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deutschrap.blogspot.com/2008/03/classic-german-hip-hop.html|title=Classic German Hip-Hop|date=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Advanced Chemistry's use of the German language in their rap allows them to make claims to authenticity and true German heritage, bolstering pro-immigration sentiment, their style can also be problematic for immigrant notions of any real ethnic roots. Indeed, part of the Turkish ethnic minority of [[Frankfurt]] views Advanced Chemistry's appeal to the German image as a "symbolic betrayal of the right of ethnic minorities to 'roots' or to any expression of cultural heritage."&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; In this sense, their rap represents a complex social discourse internal to the [[German soundscape]] in which they attempt to negotiate immigrant assimilation into a xenophobic [[Culture of Germany|German culture]] with the maintenance of their own separate cultural traditions. It is quite possibly the feelings of alienation from the pure-blooded German demographic that drive Advanced Chemistry to attack nationalistic ideologies by asserting their "Germanness" as a group composed primarily of ethnic others. The response to this pseudo-German authenticity can be seen in what [[Andy Bennett]] refers to as "alternative forms of local hip hop culture which actively seek to rediscover and, in many cases, reconstruct notions of identity tied to cultural roots."&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;Bennett, Andy. "Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities." In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177-200. New York; London: Routledge, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; These alternative local hip hop cultures include [[oriental hip hop]], the members of which cling to their Turkish heritage and are confused by Advanced Chemistry's elicitation of a German identity politics to which they technically do not belong. This cultural binary illustrates that rap has taken different routes in Germany and that, even among an already isolated immigrant population, there is still disunity and, especially, disagreement on the relative importance of assimilation versus cultural defiance. According to German hip hop enthusiast 9@home, Advanced Chemistry is part of a "hip-hop movement [which] took a clear stance for the minorities and against the [marginalization] of immigrants who...might be German on paper, but not in real life,"&lt;ref&gt;9@home. "German Hip Hop 1: Advanced Chemistry." Leave Your Nine at Home. 13 Oct. 2007. Vanila Mist.  27 Mar. 2008 [http://leaveyournineathome.wordpress.com/2007/10/13/german-hip-hop-1-advanced-chemistry/]&lt;/ref&gt; which speaks to the group's hope of actually being recognized as German citizens and not foreigners, despite their various other ethnic and cultural ties.

==Influences==
Advanced Chemistry's work was rooted in German history and the country's specific political realities. However, they also drew inspiration from African-American hip-hop acts like [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]], who had helped bring a soulful sound and political consciousness to American hip-hop. One member, Torch, later explicitly listed his references on his solo song "Als (When I Was in School):" "My favorite subject, which was quickly discovered poetry in load Poets, awakens the intellect or policy at Chuck D I'll never forget the lyrics by Public Enemy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Torch-als-ich-zur-schule-ging-lyrics|title=Torch (Ft. Advanced Chemistry) – Als ich zur Schule ging|via=genius.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torch goes on to list other American rappers like [[Biz Markie]], [[Big Daddy Kane]] and [[Dr. Dre]] as influences.

'''Albert Speer''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|p|ɛər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃpeːɐ̯|lang|De-Albert Speer.ogg|lang}}; March 19, 1905&amp;nbsp;– September 1, 1981)  served as the [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production|Minister of Armaments and War Production]] in [[Nazi Germany]] during most of [[World War II]]. A close ally of [[Adolf Hitler]], he was convicted at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

An architect by training, Speer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]]. In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for Berlin. In this capacity he was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement that [[Nazi persecution of Jews|evicted Jewish tenants]] from their homes in Berlin. In February 1942, Speer was appointed as [[Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production]]. Using misleading statistics, he promoted himself as having performed an "armaments miracle" that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=174-75}} In 1944, Speer established a [[Jägerstab|task force]] to increase production of fighter aircraft. It became instrumental in the exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] for the benefit of the German war effort.

After the war, Speer was among the 24 "major [[List of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes|war criminals]]" arrested and charged with the crimes of the Nazi regime at the Nuremberg trials. He was found guilty of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], principally for the use of slave labor, narrowly avoiding a death sentence. Having served his full term, Speer was released in 1966. He used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]''. Speer's books were a success; the public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich. Speer died of a [[stroke]] in 1981. Little remains of his personal architectural work.

Through his autobiographies and interviews, Speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich. He continued to deny explicit knowledge of, and responsibility for, [[the Holocaust]]. This image dominated his [[historiography]] in the decades following the war, giving rise to the "Speer Myth": the perception of him as an [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] [[Technocracy|technocrat]] responsible for revolutionizing the German war machine. The myth began to fall apart in the 1980s, when the armaments miracle was attributed to [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. [[Adam Tooze]] wrote in ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'' that the idea that Speer was an apolitical technocrat was "absurd". [[Martin Kitchen]], writing in ''[[Speer: Hitler's Architect]]'', stated that much of the increase in Germany's arms production was actually due to systems instituted by Speer's predecessor ([[Fritz Todt]]) and furthermore that Speer was intimately involved in the "[[Final Solution]]".

==Early years and personal life==
Speer was born in [[Mannheim]], into an upper-middle-class family. He was the second of three sons of Luise Máthilde Wilhelmine (Hommel) and [[Albert Friedrich Speer]].{{sfn|Schubert|2006|p=5}} In 1918, the family leased their Mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in Heidelberg.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=15}} [[Henry T. King]], deputy prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials]] who later wrote a book about Speer said, "Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth."{{sfn|King|1997|p=27}} His brothers, Ernst and Hermann, bullied him throughout his childhood.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}} Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=23}} He followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=11–13}}

Speer began his architectural studies at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=17–18}} In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the "much more reputable" [[Technical University of Munich]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=63}} In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the [[Technical University of Berlin]] where he studied under [[Heinrich Tessenow]], whom Speer greatly admired.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=18–19}} After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor for a man of 22.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=34–36}} As such, Speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=71–73}} In Munich Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with [[Rudolf Wolters]], who also studied under Tessenow.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=33–34}}

In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=47–49}} The couple would have six children together, but Albert Speer grew increasingly distant from his family after 1933. He remained so even after his release from imprisonment in 1966, despite their efforts to forge closer bonds.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–328}}
==Party architect and government functionary==
===Joining the Nazis (1931–1934)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V00555-3, Obersalzberg, Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Speer shows Hitler a project at [[Obersalzberg]].]]

In January 1931, Speer applied for [[Nazi Party]] membership, and on March 1, 1931, he became member number 474,481.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=24}} &lt;ref&gt;On 31 January 1931 He also joined the Motor Unit of the SA being a member until autumn 1932. On 20 July 1942 Speer was enrolled by order of Heinrich Himmler as a SS Man/member of Personal Staff of the SS Reichsfurher [SS Number 46104]. However his application was never completed, becoming ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. [Nazi conspiracy and aggresion vol. VI pp. 256 Document 3568-PS]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, with stipends shrinking amid [[the Depression]], Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow's assistant and moved to Mannheim, hoping to make a living as an architect. After he failed to do so, his father gave him a part-time job as manager of his properties. In July&amp;nbsp;1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party before the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' [[Weimar republic#Elections of July 1932|elections]]. While they were there his friend, Nazi Party official [[Karl Hanke]] recommended the young architect to [[Joseph Goebbels]] to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler [[Machtergreifung|took office]] in January&amp;nbsp;1933.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=25–26}}

The organizers of the 1933 [[Nuremberg Rally]] asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor [[Rudolf Hess]] were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler's Munich apartment to seek his approval.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=100–101}} This work won Speer his first national post, as Nazi Party "Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations".{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=49}}

Shortly after Hitler came into power, he began to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933, he contracted [[Paul Troost]] to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=41}} As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=101–03}} Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on him in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=106}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=41–42}}

In the English version of his memoirs, Speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his "monthly dues". He assumed his German readers would not be so gullible and told them the Nazi Party offered a "new mission". He was more forthright in an interview with William Hamsher in which he said he joined the party in order to save "Germany from Communism". After the war, he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance. Like many of those in power in the Third Reich, he was not an ideologue, "nor was he anything more than an instinctive anti-Semite."{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=24}} The historian [[Magnus Brechtken]], discussing Speer, said he did not give anti-Jewish public speeches and that his [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] can best be understood through his actions—which were anti-Semitic.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}} Brechtken added that, throughout Speer's life, his central motives were to gain power, rule, and acquire wealth.{{sfn|Brechtken|2017|p=45}}

When Troost died on January 21, 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party's chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess's staff.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=60}}

One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in [[Nuremberg]]. It was used for [[Nazi party rally grounds|Nazi propaganda rallies]] and can be seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. The building was able to hold 340,000 people.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=59}} Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight Nazis.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=131}} Nuremberg was the site of many official Nazi buildings. Many more buildings were planned. If built, the [[Deutsches Stadion|German Stadium]] would have accommodated 400,000 spectators.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=59}} Speer modified [[Werner March]]'s design for the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)#1936–1945: Olympiastadion|Olympic Stadium]] being built for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=65}} Speer designed the German Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 international exposition in Paris]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=60}}

===Berlin's General Building Inspector (1937–1942)===
[[File:Welthauptstadt germania 11.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the Große Halle (also called Ruhmeshalle or Volkshalle) with the [[Reichstag building]] and the [[Brandenburg Gate]]]]

In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital. This carried with it the rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=64}} It also made Speer a member of the ''Reichstag'', though the body by then [[Enabling Act of 1933|had little effective power]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=144}} Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to [[Germania (city)|rebuild Berlin]]. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the ''Prachtstrasse'', or Street of Magnificence;{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=140}} he also referred to it as the "North–South Axis".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=141}} At the northern end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'', a huge domed assembly hall over {{convert|700|ft|m|-1}} high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue, a great triumphal arch, almost {{convert|400|ft|m|-1}} high and able to fit the [[Arc de Triomphe]] inside its opening, was planned. The existing Berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled, and two large new stations built.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=65–70}} Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the ''Prachtstrasse''.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=27}} The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=71}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Volkshalle's Great Dome can be seen at the top of this model of Hitler's plan for Berlin.]]

Plans to build a new Reich chancellery had been underway since 1934. Land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March 1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at [[Voßstraße]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46–47}} Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. In the aftermath of the [[Night of the Long Knives]], he had been commissioned to renovate the [[Borsig Palace]] on the corner of Voßstraße and [[Wilhelmstraße]] as headquarters of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=45}} He completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by May 1936. In June 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30,000 Reichsmark and estimated the chancellery would be completed within three to four years. Detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on January 1, 1938. On January 27, 1938, Speer received plenipotentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancellery by January 1, 1939. For propaganda Hitler claimed during the topping-out ceremony on August 2, 1938, that he had ordered Speer to complete the new chancellery that year.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46–49}} Shortages of labor meant the construction workers had to work in ten-to-twelve-hour shifts.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}} The ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) built two concentration camps in 1938 and used the inmates to quarry stone for its construction. A brick factory was built near the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]] at Speer's behest; when someone commented on the poor conditions there, Speer stated, "The Yids got used to making bricks while in Egyptian captivity".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=72}} The chancellery was completed in early January 1939.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}} The building itself was hailed by Hitler as the "crowning glory of the greater German political empire".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}}

[[File:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitler in Paris in 1940 with Speer (left) and sculptor [[Arno Breker]]]]
During the Chancellery project, the [[pogrom]] of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of ''Inside the Third Reich''. It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=164}} ''Kristallnacht'' accelerated Speer's ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin's Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer's Department used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=116}} Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=120}} Speer denied he knew they were being put on [[Holocaust trains]] and claimed that those displaced were, "Completely free and their families were still in their apartments".{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=189}} He also said: "&amp;nbsp;... en route to my ministry on the city highway, I could see&amp;nbsp;... crowds of people on the platform of nearby Nikolassee Railroad Station. I knew that these must be Berlin Jews who were being evacuated. I am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as I drove past. I presumably had a sense of somber events."{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=189}} [[Matthias Schmidt]] said Speer had personally inspected [[concentration camps]] and described his comments as an "outright farce".{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=190}} Martin Kitchen described Speer's often repeated line that he knew nothing of the "dreadful things" as hollow—because not only was he fully aware of the fate of the Jews he was actively participating in their persecution.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=322}}

As Germany started World War II in Europe, Speer instituted quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=115}} Speer used forced Jewish labor on these projects, in addition to regular German workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=78}} Construction stopped on the Berlin and Nüremberg plans at the outbreak of war. Though stockpiling of materials and other work continued, this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for the armament industry.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=39–40}} Speer's offices undertook building work for each branch of the military, and for the SS, using slave labor.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=78}} Speer's building work made him among the wealthiest of the Nazi elite.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=75–76}}

==Minister of Armaments==
===Appointment and increasing power===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16636, Nordeuropa, Eduard Dietl, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Speer (wearing [[Organisation Todt]] armband) and ''Wehrmacht'' general [[Eduard Dietl]] at [[Rovaniemi Airport]] in Finland, December 1943]]

On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's [[Wolf's Lair|eastern headquarters]] at [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]]. Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=117–118}} Hitler appointed Speer in Todt's place. [[Martin Kitchen]], a British historian, says that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=120–121}} Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the [[Organisation Todt]], a massive, government-controlled construction company.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=6}} Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. As an example, he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under [[Hermann Göring]]'s [[Four Year Plan]]. Göring was reluctant to grant this. However Speer secured Hitler's support, and on March 1, 1942, Göring signed a decree naming Speer "General Plenipotentiary for Armament Tasks" in the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Carroll|2018|p=234}} Speer proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=148–149}}

Speer was fêted at the time, and in the post-war era, for performing an "armaments miracle" in which German war production dramatically increased. This "miracle" was brought to a halt in the summer of 1943 by, among other factors, the [[Battle of the Ruhr|first]] sustained [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=597–598}} Other factors probably contributed to the increase more than Speer himself. Germany's armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor, Todt. Naval armaments were not under Speer's supervision until October 1943, nor the Luftwaffe's armaments until June of the following year. Yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under Speer's control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=368–370}} Another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=575–576}} Production of every type of weapon peaked in June and July 1944, but there was now a severe shortage of fuel. After August 1944, oil from the Romanian fields was no longer available. Oil production became so low that any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=232–233}}

As Minister of Armaments, Speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=127}} With Hitler's full agreement, he decided to prioritize tank production, and he was given unrivalled power to ensure success.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=145–147}} Hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks, but kept changing his mind about the specifications. This delayed the program, and Speer was unable to remedy the situation. In consequence, despite tank production having the highest priority, relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it. This led to a significant German Army failure at the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]], a major turning point on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet [[Red Army]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=147–148}}

As head of Organisation Todt, Speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps. He agreed to expand [[Auschwitz]] and some other camps, allocating 13.7 million Reichsmarks for the work to be carried out. This allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at Auschwitz, increasing the total human capacity to 132,000. Included in the building works was material to build [[Nazi gas chamber|gas chambers]], crematoria and morgues. The SS called this "Professor Speer's Special Programme".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=156}}

Speer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces, there was a labor shortage in the war economy, and not enough workers for his factories. In response, Hitler appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]] as a "manpower dictator" to obtain new workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=150}} Speer and Sauckel cooperated closely to meet Speer's labor demands.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=151–152}} Hitler gave Sauckel a free hand to obtain labor, something that delighted Speer, who had requested 1,000,000 "voluntary" laborers to meet the need for armament workers. Sauckel had whole villages in France, Holland and Belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to Speer's factories.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=159}} Sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=146–150}} In occupied areas of the Soviet Union, that had been subject to partisan action, civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=165–166}} By April 1943, Sauckel had supplied 1,568,801 "voluntary" laborers, forced laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to Speer for use in his armaments factories. It was for the maltreatment of these people, that Speer was principally convicted at the Nuremberg Trials.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=160}}

===Consolidation of arms production===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28426, A. Speer, E. Milch, W. Messerschmitt.jpg|thumb|Speer with Luftwaffe field marshal [[Erhard Milch]] and aircraft designer [[Willy Messerschmitt]], May 1944]]
Following his appointment as Minister of Armaments, Speer was in control of armaments production solely for the [[German Army (1935–1945)|Army]]. He coveted control of the production of armaments for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as well. He set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}} His close relationship with Hitler provided him with political protection, and he was able to outwit and outmanoeuver his rivals in the regime. Hitler's cabinet was dismayed at his tactics, but, regardless, he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}} By July 1943, he had gained control of armaments production for the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Kriegsmarine''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=167–169}} In August 1943, he took control of most of the Ministry of Economics, to become, in [[Admiral Dönitz]]'s words, "Europe's economic dictator". His formal title was changed on September 2, 1943 to "Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production". He had become one of the most powerful people in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}}

Speer and his hand-picked director of submarine construction [[Otto Merker]] believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods, and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=614}} This belief proved incorrect, and Speer and Merker's attempt to build the ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s new generation of submarines, the [[Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]], as [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program. The designs were rushed into production, and the completed submarines were crippled by flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed. While dozens of submarines were built, few ever entered service.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=616–618}}

In December 1943, Speer visited Organisation Todt workers in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8–9}} He was under the dubious care of Professor [[Karl Gebhardt]] at a medical clinic called Hohenlychen where patients "mysteriously failed to survive".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=188}} In mid-January 1944, Speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill. Concerned about retaining power, he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the Armaments Ministry from his bedside. Speer's illness coincided with the Allied "[[Big Week]]", a series of bombing raids on the German aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=188–189}} His political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with Hitler. He lost Hitler's unconditional support and began to lose power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8–9}}

In response to the Allied Big Week, [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized the creation of a [[Jägerstab|Fighter Staff committee]]. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the March 1, 1944, orders of Speer, with support from [[Erhard Milch]] of the Reich Aviation Ministry.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=347|2006}} Production of German fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}} The growth, however, consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for Allied aircraft.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=582–584}} On August 1, 1944, Speer merged the Fighter Staff into a newly formed [[Rüstungsstab|Armament Staff committee]].{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=82}}

[[File:Überlebende KZ Mühldorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Survivors of the [[Mühldorf concentration camp complex|Mühldorf concentration camp]] upon liberation in 1945. Mühldorf supplied slave workers for the [[Weingut I]] project.]]

The Fighter Staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] in the war economy.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=45|2014}} The SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including [[Mittelbau-Dora]]. Prisoners worked for [[Junkers]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Henschel &amp; Son|Henschel]] and [[BMW#1939–1945: World War II|BMW]], among others.{{sfn|Buggeln|pp=46–48|2014}} To increase production, Speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce. Those who feigned illness, slacked off, sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps. In 1944 this became endemic; over half a million workers were arrested.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=215}} By this time, 140,000 people were working in Speer's underground factories. These factories were death-traps; discipline was brutal, with regular executions. There were so many corpses at the Dora underground factory, for example, that the crematorium was overwhelmed. Speer's own staff described the conditions there as "hell".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}

The largest technological advance under Speer's command came through the rocket program. It began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry. Speer enthusiastically supported the program and in March 1942 made an order for A4 rockets, the predecessor of the world's first ballistic missile, the [[V-2 rocket]]. The rockets were researched at a facility in [[Peenemünde]] along with the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. The V-2's first target was Paris on September 8, 1944. The program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy. The large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=216}} The rockets were built at an underground factory at [[Mittelwerk]]. Labor to build the A4 rockets came from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Of the 60,000 people who ended up at the camp 20,000 died, due to the appalling conditions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}

By the summer of 1944 Speer had lost control of Organisation Todt and armaments.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}} He opposed the [[20 July plot|assassination attempt against Hitler]] on July 20, 1944. He was not involved in the plot, and played a minor role in the regime's efforts to regain control over Berlin after Hitler survived.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=204–205}} After the plot Speer's rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party. He lost yet more authority.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}}

===Defeat of Nazi Germany===
[[File:Nazi Personalities BU6713.jpg|thumb|Speer (left), [[Karl Dönitz]] and [[Alfred Jodl]] (right) after their arrest by the British Army in [[Flensburg]] in Northern Germany in May 1945]]
Losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the Allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the German economy from late 1944. Air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective, as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=648–651}} In January 1945, Speer told Goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=652}} However, he concluded that the war was lost after Soviet forces captured the important [[Silesia]]n industrial region later that month.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=259}} Nevertheless, Speer believed that Germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the Allies than the [[unconditional surrender]] they insisted upon.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} During January and February, Speer claimed that his ministry would deliver "decisive weapons" and a large increase in armaments production which would "bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=254}} Speer gained control over the railways in February, and asked Himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=261–262}}

By mid-March, Speer had accepted that Germany's economy would collapse within the next eight weeks. While he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture, so that they could be used after the war, he still supported the war's continuation. Speer provided Hitler with a memorandum on March 15, which detailed Germany's dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure. Three days later, he also proposed to Hitler that Germany's remaining military resources be concentrated along the [[Rhine]] and [[Vistula]] rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting. This ignored military realities, as the German armed forces were unable to match the Allies' firepower and were facing total defeat.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=652–653}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=262–263}} Hitler rejected Speer's proposal to cease demolitions. Instead, he issued the "[[Nero Decree]]" on March 19, which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated. Speer was appalled by this order, and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=265–267}} During a meeting with Speer on March 28/29, Hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=269–270}} Speer ended them, though the army continued to blow up bridges.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=291}}{{efn|For a treatise on this aspect of the war including Speer's involvement see: Randall, Hansen, ''Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance in the Last Year of WWII'', Faber &amp; Faber, 2014, 1st edition, {{ISBN|978-0-571-28451-1}}.}}

By April, little was left of the armaments industry, and Speer had few official duties.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=275}} Speer visited the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' on April 22 for the last time. He met Hitler and toured the damaged Chancellery before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263–270}} On April 29, the day before committing suicide, Hitler dictated a [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]] which dropped Speer from the successor government. Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl Saur|Karl-Otto Saur]].{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=234}} Speer was disappointed that Hitler had not selected him as his successor.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=277}} After Hitler's death, Speer offered his services to the so-called [[Flensburg Government]], headed by Hitler's successor, [[Karl Dönitz]]. He took a role in that short-lived regime as Minister of Industry and Production.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=273–281}} Speer provided information to the Allies, regarding the effects of the air war, and on a broad range of subjects, beginning on May 10. On May 23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=288}}

==Post-war==
===Nuremberg trial===
{{Main|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg|thumb|Speer at the Nuremberg trial]]
Speer was taken to several internment centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September 1945, he was told that he would be tried for [[war crime]]s, and several days later, he was moved to Nuremberg and incarcerated there.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=561}} Speer was indicted on four counts: participating in a common plan or [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of [[crime against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]] and other crimes against peace; war crimes; and [[crimes against humanity]].{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=285}}

The chief United States prosecutor, [[Robert H. Jackson]], of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] said, "Speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation."{{sfn|Conot|1983|p=471}} Speer's attorney, Hans Flächsner, presented Speer as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non-ideologue.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=287–288}}

Speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, principally for the use of slave labor and forced labor. He was acquitted on the other two counts. He had claimed that he was unaware of Nazi extermination plans, and the Allies had no proof that he was aware, and this probably saved him from hanging. His claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007.{{sfn|Connolly|2007}} On October 1, 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=281–282}} While three of the eight judges (two Soviet and American [[Francis Biddle]]) advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=29}}

===Imprisonment===
On July 18, 1947, Speer was transferred to [[Spandau Prison]] in Berlin to serve his prison term.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=288}} There he was known as Prisoner Number Five.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=314–315}} Speer's parents died while he was incarcerated. His father, who died in 1947, despised the Nazis and was silent upon meeting Hitler. His mother died in 1952. As a Nazi member, she had greatly enjoyed dining with Hitler.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}} Wolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication he was officially allowed. Beginning in 1948, Speer had the services of Toni Proost, a sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail and his writings.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=292–297}}
[[File:6th Inf Regt Spandau Prison 1951.jpg|thumb|left|Speer spent most of his sentence at [[Spandau Prison]].]]

In 1949, Wolters opened a bank account for Speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. Initially, the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but increasingly the money was used for other purposes. They paid for Toni Proost to go on holiday, and for bribes to those who might be able to secure Speer's release. Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he sent detailed instructions about what to do with the money.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=292–297}} Wolters raised a total of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=298}}

The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs. Speer was able to have his writings sent to Wolters, however, and they eventually amounted to 20,000 pages.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=316}} He had completed his memoirs by November 1953, which became the basis of ''Inside the Third Reich''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=325}} In ''Spandau Diaries'', Speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a [[Faustian bargain]] for which he endured a harsh prison sentence.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=321–322}}

Much of Speer's energy was dedicated to keeping fit, both physically and mentally, during his long confinement.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=323}} Spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening. Speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns, flower beds, shrubbery, and fruit trees.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=316}} To make his daily walks around the garden more engaging Speer embarked on an imaginary trip around the globe. Carefully measuring distance travelled each day, he mapped distances to the real-world geography. He had walked more than {{convert|30,000|km}}, ending his sentence near [[Guadalajara]], Mexico.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=316, 325}} Speer also read, studied architectural journals, and brushed up on English and French. In his writings, Speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison, a gross exaggeration. His sentence amounted to 7,300 days, which only allotted one and a half days per book.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=316–317}}

Speer's supporters maintained calls for his release. Among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were [[Charles de Gaulle]] and US diplomat [[George Wildman Ball]].{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=319}} [[Willy Brandt]] was an advocate of his release,{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=319}} putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against him,{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=324}} which could have caused his property to be confiscated.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=299–300}} Speer's efforts for an early release came to naught. The Soviet Union, having demanded a death sentence at trial, was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=320–321}} Speer served a full term and was released at midnight on October 1, 1966.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=324–325}}

===Release and later life===
Speer's release from prison was a worldwide media event. Reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside Spandau and the lobby of the Berlin hotel where Speer spent the night.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=320–321}} He said little, reserving most comments for a major interview published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in November 1966.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=333–334}} Although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career, his sole project, a collaboration for a brewery, was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–328}} Instead, he revised his Spandau writings into two autobiographical books, and later published a work about Himmler and the SS. His books included ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' (in German, ''Erinnerungen'', or ''Reminiscences''{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=5}}) and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]''. Speer was aided in shaping the works by [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Wolf Jobst Siedler]] from the publishing house [[Ullstein Verlag|Ullstein]].{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=329–330}} He found himself unable to re-establish a relationship with his children, even with his son [[Albert Speer (born 1934)|Albert]] who had also become an architect. According to Speer's daughter [[Hilde Schramm]], "One by one my sister and brothers gave up. There was no communication."{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=664–665}} He supported Hermann, his brother, financially after the war. However, his other brother Ernst had died in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], despite repeated requests from his parents for Speer to repatriate him.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}}

Following his release from Spandau, Speer donated the ''Chronicle'', his personal diary, to the [[German Federal Archives]]. It had been edited by Wolters and made no mention of the Jews.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=339–343}} [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited ''Chronicle'' and independent documents. Speer asked Wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but Wolters refused and retained an original copy.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=226–227}} Wolters' friendship with Speer deteriorated and one year before Speer's death Wolters gave Matthias Schmidt access to the unedited ''Chronicle''. Schmidt authored the first book that was highly critical of Speer.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=359–361}}

Speer's memoirs were a phenomenal success. The public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight. Importantly, he provided an alibi to older Germans who had been Nazis. If Speer, who had been so close to Hitler, had not known the full extent of the crimes of the Nazi regime and had just been "following orders", then they could tell themselves and others they too had done the same.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=335}} Speer provided a whitewash for an entire generation of older Germans. So great was the need to believe this "Speer Myth" that Fest and Siedler were able to strengthen it—even in the face of mounting historical evidence to the contrary.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=366}}

===Death===
[[File:A speer grab-1.jpg|thumb|Speer's grave in [[Heidelberg]]]]
Speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=354}} In October 1973, he made his first trip to Britain, flying to London to be interviewed on the [[BBC]] ''Midweek'' programme.{{sfn|Asher|2003}} In the same year, he appeared on the television programme ''[[The World at War]]''. Speer returned to London in 1981 to participate in the BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme. He suffered a stroke and died in London on September 1.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=337}}

He had remained married to his wife, but he had formed a relationship with a German woman living in London and was with her at the time of his death.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=362–363}} His daughter, [[Margret Nissen]], wrote in her 2005 memoirs that after his release from Spandau he spent all of his time constructing the "Speer Myth".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=343}}

==The Speer myth==
===The Good Nazi===
After his release from Spandau, Speer portrayed himself as the "good Nazi".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–360}} He was well-educated, middle class, [[bourgeois]] and could contrast himself with the [[psychopaths]] and murderers who, in the popular mind, typified "bad Nazis".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=362}} In his memoirs and interviews, he had distorted the truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as "myths".{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Speer took his myth-making to a mass media level and his "cunning apologies" were reproduced countless times in post-war Germany.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} [[Isabell Trommer]] writes in her biography of Speer that Fest and Siedler were co-authors of Speer's memoirs and co-creators of his myths.{{sfn|Trommer|2016|p=80}} In return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements.{{sfn|Schwendemann|2016}} Speer, Siedler and Fest had constructed a masterpiece; the image of the "good Nazi" remained in place for decades, despite historical evidence indicating that it was false.{{sfn|Trommer|2016|p=330}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-052-06A, Albert Speer spricht in Munitionsfabrik.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of a group of men wearing business suits raising their right arms in a Nazi salute|Speer during a visit to a munitions factory in May 1944]]

Speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=345–346}} After Speer's death, Matthias Schmidt published a book that demonstrated that Speer had ordered the eviction of Jews from their Berlin homes.{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=186}} By 1999, historians had amply demonstrated that he had lied extensively.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=360–362}} Even so, public perceptions of Speer did not change substantially until [[Heinrich Breloer]] aired a biographical film on TV in 2004. The film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=335}} [[Adam Tooze]] in his book ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'' said Speer had manoeuvred himself through the ranks of the regime skillfully and ruthlessly and that the idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was "absurd".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=553}} Trommer said he was not an apolitical technocrat; instead, he was one of the most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Schwendemann|2016}} Kitchen said he had deceived the Nuremberg Tribunal and post-war Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=360–362}} Brechtken said that if his extensive involvement in the Holocaust had been known at the time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}}

The image of the good Nazi was supported by numerous Speer myths.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} In addition to the myth that he was an apolitical technocrat, he claimed he did not have full knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] or the persecution of the Jews. Another myth posits that Speer revolutionized the German war machine after his appointment as Minister of Armaments. He was credited with a dramatic increase in the shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping Germany in the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=552}} Another myth centered around a faked plan to assassinate Hitler with poisonous gas. The idea for this myth came to him after he recalled the panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system. He fabricated the additional details.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=296–297}} Brechtken wrote that his most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a French journalist in 1952. The journalist described an invented scenario in which Speer had refused Hitler's orders and Hitler had left with tears in his eyes. Speer liked the scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs. The journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}}

Speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of Hitler's leadership. Despite his opposition to the [[20 July plot]], he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters. He maintained Hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers. This formed a key element of the myths Speer encouraged.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=205}} Speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage, and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian population's survival.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} In reality, he had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible, thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction Germany suffered in the conflict's final months.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}}{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=653}}

===Denial of responsibility===
{{external media|align=left||image1=[https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2018/12/18/albert-speer-chief-architect-of-the-third-reich/ Photograph of Speer at Mauthausen]}}

Speer maintained at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the Holocaust. He admitted only to being uncomfortable around Jews in the published version of the ''Spandau Diaries''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=322}} More broadly, Speer accepted responsibility for the Nazi regime's actions. Historian Martin Kitchen states that Speer was actually "fully aware of what had happened to the Jews" and was "intimately involved in the '[[Final Solution]]'".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=100, 322}} Brechtken said Speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the Holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Speer was photographed with slave laborers at [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] during a visit on 31 March 1943; he also visited [[Gusen concentration camp]]. Although survivor [[Francisco Boix]] testified at the Nuremberg trials about Speer's visit,{{sfn|Pike|2003|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W_6CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 340, fn 40]}} Taylor writes that, had the photo been available, he would have been hanged.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=204–205}} In 2005, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were massacred.{{sfn|Connolly|2005}} Heinrich Breloer, discussing the construction of Auschwitz, said Speer was not just a cog in the work—he was the "terror itself".{{sfn|Connolly|2005}}

Speer denied being present at the [[Posen speeches]] to Nazi leaders at a conference in Posen ([[Poznań]]) on October 6, 1943. Himmler said during his speech, "The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth",{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=167–168}} and later, "The Jews must be exterminated".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler addresses him directly.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} In 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a letter from Speer dated December 23, 1971, had been found in a collection of his correspondence with Hélène Jeanty, the widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer says, "There is no doubt—I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed."{{sfn|Connolly|2007}}

===Armaments "miracle"===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|right|The German city of Cologne in ruins at the end of the war]]
Speer was credited with an "armaments miracle". During the winter of 1941–42, in the light of Germany's disastrous defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]], the German leadership including Fromm, Thomas and Todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} The rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat. Speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} He produced spectacular statistics, claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production, a fourfold increase in artillery production, and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country. He was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}}

The armaments "miracle" was a myth; Speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=555}} The production of armaments did go up; however, this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before Speer came to office, the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity. By July 1943 Speer's armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the German public.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=552–557}} Brechtken writes that Speer knew Germany was going to lose the war and deliberately extended its length, thus causing the deaths of millions of people in the death camps and on the battlefield who would have otherwise lived.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Kitchen said "There can be no doubt that Speer did indeed help to prolong the war longer than many thought possible, as a result of which millions were killed and Germany reduced to a pile of rubble".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=364}}

==Architectural legacy==
[[File:09055087 Berlin Tempelhof, General-Pape-Straße 002.JPG|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of a cylindrical structure|''Schwerbelastungskörper'' in 2011]]

Little remains of Speer's personal architectural works, other than the plans and photographs. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the ''[[Schwerbelastungskörper]]'', a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, {{convert|46|ft|m|adj=off|order=flip|abbr=}} high, was used to measure ground [[subsidence]] as part of feasibility studies for a massive [[triumphal arch]] and other large structures proposed as part of ''[[Germania (city)|Welthauptstadt Germania]]'', Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=75}} The [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] of the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, can also be seen.{{sfn|Museen der Stadt Nürnberg}}

During the war, the Speer-designed [[Reich Chancellery#New Reich Chancellery|Reich Chancellery]] was largely destroyed by air raids and in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. The exterior walls survived, but they were eventually dismantled by the Soviets. Unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], [[Mohrenstraße (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mohrenstraße metro station]] and Soviet war memorials in Berlin.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=56}}

Aachen is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], {{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Cologne]]&lt;ref name="CVDE"&gt;{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{harvnb|Bayer|2000|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a former coal-mining area.&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; One of Germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology, the [[RWTH Aachen University]], is located in the city.&lt;ref name="rwth-aachen.de"&gt;{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology. In 2009, Aachen was ranked eighth among cities in Germany for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name ''Aachen'' is a modern descendant, like southern German {{lang|de|Ach(e)}}, {{lang-de|Aach}}, meaning "river" or "stream", from [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ahha}}, meaning "water" or "stream", which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds) to [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Aquae}}, referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the [[Neolithic]] era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm [[mineral spring]]s. Latin {{lang|la|Aquae}} figures in Aachen's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name {{lang|la|Aquae granni}}, which meant "waters of [[Grannus]]", referring to the [[Celts|Celtic]] god of healing who was worshipped at the springs.&lt;ref name="munro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tourism"&gt;{{harvnb|Mielke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This word became {{lang|wa|Åxhe}} in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and {{lang|fr|Aix}} in French, and subsequently {{lang|fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}} after [[Charlemagne]] had his [[palatine Chapel, Aachen|palatine chapel]] built there in the late 8th century and then made the city his empire's capital.

As a spa city, Aachen has the right to name itself ''Bad Aachen'', but chooses not to, so it remains on the top of alphabetical lists.

Aachen's name in French and German evolved in parallel. The city is known by a variety of different names in other languages:

=== Aachen dialect ===
Aachen is at the western end of the [[Benrath line]] that divides [[High German languages|High German]] to the south from the rest of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] speech area to the north.&lt;ref name="Anon 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's local dialect is called {{lang|de|[[Aachen dialect|Öcher Platt]]}} and belongs to the [[Ripuarian language]].

== History ==
{{see also|Free Imperial City of Aachen|Timeline of Aachen}}

=== Early history ===
Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3000–2500 BC), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around 124 AD. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel,&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;{{efn|This audio file is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Archäologie am Hof''.}} adding at the end of the same century the ''Münstertherme'' spa,&lt;ref name="Anon 2013"/&gt; two water pipelines, and a probable{{clarify|date=December 2016}} sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Freimann|1906|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelimünster/Walheim]]. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses,&lt;ref name="DofA"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse.

Roman civil administration in Aachen broke down between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries&lt;!--{{Fix|text=This seems rather precise}} What is that supposed to imply?--&gt;. Rome withdrew its troops from the area, but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]&lt;ref name="Coll"&gt;{{harvnb|Held|1997|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
[[File:Aachener Heiligtumszeigung Oelgemaelde 17Jh.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the four "Great Relics" during the Aachen [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]], after a 17th-century painting]]

After Roman times, [[Pepin the Short]] had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the [[Rhineland]] and northern France.&lt;ref name="DofA2"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' (''{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eginhard|2012|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ("and [he] celebrated Christmas in the town Aquis, and similarly Easter") which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as king of the [[Francia|Franks]], 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time.{{efn|This is in dispute, as some history books state that Charlemagne was in fact born in Aachen in 742.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;}} He remained there in a mansion which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] (since 1930, cathedral) and the [[Palace of Aachen|Palace]]. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built;&lt;ref name="DofA5"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the ''[[Karlsschrein]]'', the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never officially acknowledged by the Roman Curia as such.

In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of [[East Francia]] in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. During the reign of [[Otto II]], the nobles revolted and the [[West Francia|West Frank]]s, under [[Lothair of France|Lothair]],&lt;ref name="dupuy"&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This was between 970 and 980.&lt;ref name="dupuy" /&gt;}} Aachen was attacked again by [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Odo of Champagne]], who attacked the imperial palace while [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was absent. Odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace and town of Aachen had fortifying walls built by order of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] between 1172 and 1176.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; Over the next 500 years, most kings of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned in Aachen. The original audience hall built by Charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]] in 1330.{{efn|Sources differ on the age of the [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], as the dates used for the construction were 1334–1349.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]]; it achieved a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the "Aachener Reich". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the [[Council of 837]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Jong|1996|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt;

=== Manuscript production ===
[[File:The Siege of Aachen.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Siege of Aachen (1614)|siege of Aachen]] by the Spanish Army of Flanders under Ambrogio Spinola in 1614]]
Aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts. Under Charlemagne's purview, both the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Ada Gospels]] and the [[Coronation Gospel]]s may have been produced in Aachen.&lt;ref name="DofA1"&gt;{{harvnb|McKitterick|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally. During the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814–840), substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at Aachen, including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group, [[patristic]] texts including the five manuscripts of the [[Bamberg Pliny Group]].&lt;ref name="DofA1" /&gt; Finally, under [[Lothair I]] (840–855), texts of outstanding quality were still being produced. This however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at Aachen.&lt;ref name="DofA1" /&gt;

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
[[File:Rhein-Strom 0184a Achen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Aachen in 1690]]

In 1598, following the invasion of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] troops from the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf]] deposed all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 16th century, Aachen started to lose its power and influence. First the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations of emperors]] were moved from Aachen to [[Frankfurt]]. This was followed by the [[European wars of religion|religious wars]], and the great fire of 1656.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{harvnb|''Encyclopædia Britannica''|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of most of the city in 1656, the rebuilding was mostly in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; The decline of Aachen culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General [[Charles Dumouriez]],&lt;ref name="Coll" /&gt; occupied Aachen.&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt;

In 1542, the Dutch [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and physician [[Francis Fabricius]] published his study of the health benefits of the hot springs in Aachen,&lt;ref&gt;"Fabricius, François", in ''Dictionnaire des sciences médicales: biographie médicale'', vol. 4 (Paris, C. L. F. Panckoucke, 1821), p. 92. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4OI-AAAAcAAJ On Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; and by the middle of the 17th century the city had developed a considerable reputation as a spa, although this was in part because Aachen was then – and remained well into the 19th century – a place of high-level prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history are found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas.

The main [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had [[rheumatism]] become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid.

Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in English) on 2 May 1668,&lt;ref name="dupuy1"&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=563}}.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, ending the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis in the Aachen government,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2004|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1794 Aachen lost its status as a [[free imperial city]].&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:KleineSchwimmhalle.JPG|thumb|The modern Elisabethhalle pool]]
On 9 February 1801, the [[Peace of Lunéville]] removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire "left bank" of the Rhine from Germany (the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) and granted it to France.&lt;ref name="Coll" /&gt; In 1815, control of the town was passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] through an act passed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818, to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt{{clarify|date=December 2016}} remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the "[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]" in Napoleon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over within the new [[German Confederation]]. The city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt; Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until 1875, when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new, better housing was built in the east of the city, where sanitary drainage was easiest. In December 1880, the [[Trams in Aachen|Aachen tramway network]] was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Gragt|1968|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, pins, [[sewing needle|needles]], buttons, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.

=== 20th century ===
====World War II====
{{further|Battle of Aachen}}

[[File:111-adc-2447.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|thumbtime=06:42|start=00:08|Films shot on 13, 14 and 15 October 1944 in Aachen by US forces.]]
After [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930, along with the rest of German territory west of the Rhine.&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]]. On 21 October 1923, an armed mob took over the city hall. Similar actions took place in [[Mönchengladbach|Mönchen-Gladbach]], [[Duisburg]], and [[Krefeld]]. This republic lasted only about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=614}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. According to [[Jörg Friedrich (author)|Jörg Friedrich]] in ''The Fire'' (2008), two Allied air raids on 11 April and 24 May 1944 "radically destroyed" the city. The first killed 1,525, including 212 children, and bombed six hospitals. During the second, 442 aircraft hit two railway stations, killed 207, and left 15,000 homeless. The raids also destroyed [[Eilendorf (Aachen)|Aachen-Eilendorf]] and [[Burtscheid|Aachen-Burtscheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friedrich|2008|p=[https://archive.org/details/firebombingofger00frie/page/117 117]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from 12 September to 21 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division&lt;ref name="1d"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the 3rd Armored Division assisting from the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 13 October the US 2nd Armored Division played their part, coming from the north and getting as close as [[Würselen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 30th Infantry Division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of Aachen on 16 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With reinforcements from the US 28th Infantry Division&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Aachen]] then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city, which finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.&lt;ref name="1d" /&gt;

Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.&lt;ref name="baker2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|2004|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; What remained of the city was destroyed—in some areas completely—during the fighting,&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt; mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Aachen Rathaus|Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit.

==== History of Aachen Jews ====
[[File:View of the old synagogue in Aachen after its destruction during Kristallnacht 02.jpg|thumb|View of the {{ill|Old Synagogue in Aachen|de|Alte Synagoge (Aachen)}} after its destruction during [[Kristallnacht]], November 1938]]
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com" /&gt; In 797, Isaac, a Jewish merchant, accompanied two ambassadors of [[Charlemagne]] to the court of [[Harun al-Rashid]]. He returned to Aachen in July 802, bearing an elephant called ''[[Abul-Abbas]]'' as a gift for the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 July 2003 |title=Baghdad, Jerusalem, Aachen -- On the Trail of the White Elephant |url=https://www.dw.com/en/baghdad-jerusalem-aachen-on-the-trail-of-the-white-elephant/a-923561 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=18 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the [[Aachen Cathedral|Aachen Minster]] (today's Cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called ''Aish'' or ''Ash'' (אש).

=== 21st century ===
The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.

== Geography ==
[[File:2017-05 Vaalserberg 13.jpg|thumb|The tripoint, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet at the [[Vaalserberg]]]]

Aachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]]. The town of [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands lies nearby at about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre, while the Dutch city of [[Heerlen]] and [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], are both located about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} from east to west. The city limits are {{convert|87.7|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, of which {{convert|23.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of {{convert|410|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at {{convert|125|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Climate ===
As the westernmost city in Germany&lt;ref name="munro"&gt;{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate climate zone]], with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&amp;nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in [[Bonn]] (with 669&amp;nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environment|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The January average is
{{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

== Geology ==
[[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|Layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]]

The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first= David |year=2012 |title=Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust |issue=367 |volume=367 |publisher=Geological Society of London |isbn=978-1-86239-347-9 |issn=0305-8719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.

Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[Düren]] earthquake&lt;ref name="duerenEQ"&gt;{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],&lt;ref name="Roermond"&gt;{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].

== Demographics ==

== Main sights ==

=== Aachen Cathedral ===
{{Main|Aachen Cathedral}}
[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Aachen Cathedral]]

Aachen Cathedral was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]]. Construction began ''c.'' AD 796&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; and it was, on completion ''c.'' 798,&lt;ref name="DofA3"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], Italy,&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the [[Lateran Palace]], both in quality and authority.&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; It was originally built in the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome.&lt;ref name="DofA4"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.&lt;ref name="DofA4" /&gt; The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was added around the start of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="DofA5" /&gt;

After [[Frederick Barbarossa]] [[Canonisation|canonised]] Charlemagne in 1165 the chapel became a [[Pilgrimage|destination for pilgrims]].&lt;ref name="DofA5" /&gt; For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. In the upper chamber of the gallery, Charlemagne's marble throne is housed.&lt;ref name="young2"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aachen |title=Aachen {{!}} Germany |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from Rome and [[Ravenna]], including the [[sarcophagus]] in which Charlemagne was eventually laid to rest.&lt;ref name="DofA6"&gt;{{harvnb|Gaehde|1996|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze bear from [[Gaul]] was placed inside, along with an equestrian statue from Ravenna, believed to be [[Theodric]], in contrast to a wolf and a statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Capitoline]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Bronze pieces such as the doors and railings, some of which have survived to present day, were cast in a local foundry. Finally, there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel, and where it was created. Wherever it was made, it was also a parallel to a piece in Rome, this in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt;

=== Cathedral Treasury ===
{{Main|Aachen Cathedral Treasury}}[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cross of Lothair]], Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]

Aachen Cathedral Treasury has housed, throughout its history, a collection of liturgical objects. The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once "crowned" the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Mataré]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt;

=== Aachen Rathaus ===
{{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]
The Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330,&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside one can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.&lt;ref name="young2" /&gt;

Since 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lefèvre]] are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.

=== Other sights ===
The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), {{convert|1/2|mi|m|order=flip|abbr=off}} northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine [[mannerism]], and a sample of a local [[Renaissance architecture]]. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891, when the architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[Jürgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.

There are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the [[Suermondt-Ludwig Museum]], which has a fine sculpture collection and the [[Aachen Museum of the International Press]], which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

=== Electric vehicle manufacturing ===
[[File:2016-12-10-Post Streetscooter-9409.jpg|thumb|StreetScooter ''Work'' as DHL delivery van (2016)]]

In June 2010, Achim Kampker, together with Günther Schuh, founded a small company to develop Street Scooter GmbH; in August 2014, it was renamed StreetScooter GmbH. This was a privately organised research initiative at the [[RWTH Aachen University]] which later became an independent company in Aachen. Kampker was also the founder and chairman of the European Network for Affordable and Sustainable Electromobility. In May 2014, the company announced that the city of Aachen, the city council Aachen and the savings bank Aachen had ordered electric vehicles from the company. In late 2014, approximately 70 employees were manufacturing 200 vehicles annually in the premises of the [[Waggonfabrik Talbot]], the former Talbot/Bombardier plant in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhl.com/en/press/releases/releases_2014/group/dpdhl_acquires_streetscooter_gmbh.html |title=Deutsche Post DHL acquires StreetScooter GmbH |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=9 December 2014 |website=DHL |publisher=DHL |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 [[Deutsche Post|Deutsche Post DHL Group]] purchased the StreetScooter company, which became its wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpdhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/deutsche_post_dhl_uebernimmt_streetscooter_gmbh.html Deutsche Post DHL übernimmt StreetScooter GmbH] 9.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2000 of its electric vans branded ''Work'' in Aachen by the end of the year.

In 2015, the electric vehicle start-up [[e.GO Mobile]] was founded by Günther Schuh, which started producing the e.GO Life electric passenger car and other vehicles in April 2019.

In April 2016, [[StreetScooter]] GmbH announced that it would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 of the ''Work'' vehicles annually, starting in 2017, also in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/der-tausendste-elektro-streetscooter-der-deutschen-post-14401894.html |title=Streetscooter – Der tausendste Elektro-Transporter der Post |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=23 August 2016 |website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Die Post will ihren gesamten Fuhrpark auf Elektro-Autos umstellen.

== Culture ==
[[File:Aachen Rosenmontag 2009.jpg|thumb|Aachen is also famous for its [[carnival]] (Karneval, Fasching), in which families dress in colourful costumes]]
* In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an [[anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]].
* The [[Scotch Club]] in Aachen was the first [[discothèque]] in Germany, opened from 19 October 1959 until 1992. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.
* The thriving Aachen [[black metal]] scene is among the most notable in Germany, with such bands as [[Nagelfar]], [[The Ruins of Beverast]], Graupel and Verdunkeln.
* The local speciality of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called ''[[Aachener Printen]]''. Unlike ''[[Lebkuchen]]'', a German form of [[gingerbread]] sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' use a syrup made from sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.
* Asteroid [[274835 Aachen]], discovered by amateur astronomer [[Erwin Schwab]] in 2009, was named after the city.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt; The official {{MoMP|274835|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 8 November 2019 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 118221}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).

[[FH Aachen]], Aachen University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschlüsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.

The Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen – Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia – Aachen department)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with one of its three campuses in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.

The [[German army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.&lt;ref name="MeerOpitz1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
[[File:Tivoli-Ost-Tribüne.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]

The annual [[CHIO Aachen|CHIO]] (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].

The local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run in Germany's [[Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|"Tivoli"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.&lt;ref name="GdawietzLeroi2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium "Neuer Tivoli" – meaning [[New Tivoli]]—a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

The Ladies in Black women's volleyball team (part of the "PTSV Aachen" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Aachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne–Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne–Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway|Mönchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].

===Intercity bus stations===
There are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Straße, in the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|last=Travelinho|title=Aachen: Stations|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it attained a maximum length of {{convert|213.5|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=off}} in 1915, becoming the fourth-longest tram network in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals–Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.

Today, the ASEAG (''Aachener Straßenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally "Aachen tram and power supply company") operates a {{convert|1240.8|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|frac=8}} bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively. ASEAG is one of the main participants in the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV), a tariff association in the region. Along with ASEAG, city bus routes of Aachen are served by private contractors such as Sadar, Taeter, Schlömer, or [[DB Regio Bus]]. Line 350, which runs from [[Maastricht]], also enters Aachen.

=== Roads ===
Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (west-east), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (north-south) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.

=== Airport ===
[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 nautical miles (28&amp;nbsp;km; 17&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.

Recreational aviation is served by the (formerly military) [[Aachen Merzbrück Airfield]].

[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]

Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].

The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an "Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal", which was awarded for the only time ever.

'''Astoria''' is a [[Port|port city]] and the seat of [[Clatsop County, Oregon]], United States. Founded in 1811, Astoria is the oldest city in the state of Oregon and was the first American settlement west of the [[Rocky Mountains]].{{sfn|Lescroart|2009|p=981}} The county is the northwest corner of Oregon, and Astoria is located on the south shore of the [[Columbia River]], where the river flows into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The city is named for [[John Jacob Astor]], an investor and entrepreneur from New York City, whose [[American Fur Company]] founded [[Fort Astoria]] at the site and established a monopoly in the fur trade in the early nineteenth century. Astoria was incorporated by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] on October 20, 1876.&lt;ref name=incorp /&gt;

The city is served by the deepwater Port of Astoria. Transportation includes the [[Astoria Regional Airport]]. [[U.S. Route 30 in Oregon|U.S. Route 30]] and [[U.S. Route 101 in Oregon|U.S. Route 101]] are the main highways, and the {{convert|4.1|mi|adj=on}} [[Astoria–Megler Bridge]] connects to neighboring [[Washington (state)|Washington]] across the river. The population was 9,477 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].&lt;ref name="2010 census"&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Census profiles: Oregon cities alphabetically A-C|url=http://www.pdx.edu/sites/www.pdx.edu.prc/files/media_assets/2010_PL94_cities_A-C_updated.pdf|publisher=Portland State University Population Research Center|access-date=June 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303231317/http://www.pdx.edu/sites/www.pdx.edu.prc/files/media_assets/2010_PL94_cities_A-C_updated.pdf|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== 19th century ===
The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] spent the winter of 1805–1806 at [[Fort Clatsop]], a small log structure southwest of modern-day Astoria. The expedition had hoped a ship would come by that could take them back east, but instead they endured a torturous winter of rain and cold. They later returned overland and by internal rivers, the way they had traveled west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Clark|author2-link=Meriwether Lewis |author2=Meriwether Lewis |title= The Journals of Lewis and Clark, 1804–1806 |edition= Library of Alexandria |year= 2015 |isbn= 978-1-613-10310-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NrOUUf7288C&amp;pg=PP1|author1-link=William Clark }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the fort has been recreated and is part of [[Lewis and Clark National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History &amp; Culture: Places: Fort Clatsop – "The National Park Service maintains a replica fort within the Lewis and Clark National Historical Park that is believed to sit on or near the site of the original fort." |publisher= National Park Service / U.S. Department of the Interior|access-date=May 12, 2016|url=https://www.nps.gov/lewi/learn/historyculture/histcult-places-focl.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, British explorer [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], the first person known to have navigated the [[David Thompson (explorer)#Columbia River travels|entire length]] of the Columbia River, reached the partially constructed [[Fort Astoria]] near the mouth of the river. He arrived two months after the [[Pacific Fur Company]]'s ship, the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]''.{{Sfn|Meinig|1995|pages=37–38, 50}} The fort constructed by the ''Tonquin'' party established Astoria as a U.S., rather than a British, settlement,{{Sfn|Meinig|1995|pages=37–38, 50}} became a vital post for American exploration of the continent. It was later used as an American claim in the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] with European nations.

The Pacific Fur Company, a subsidiary of John Jacob Astor's [[American Fur Company]], was created to begin fur trading in the [[Oregon Country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ronda | first= James |title=Astoria &amp; Empire |url= https://archive.org/details/astoriaempire0000rond |url-access= registration |year= 1995 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn= 0-8032-3896-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[War of 1812]], in 1813, the company's officers sold its assets to their Canadian rivals, the [[North West Company]]. The fur trade would remain under British control until U.S. pioneers following the [[Oregon Trail]] began filtering into the town in the mid-1840s. The [[Treaty of 1818]] established joint U.S.&amp;nbsp;– British occupancy of the Oregon Country.&lt;ref name="US Treaties in Force 2005"&gt;{{cite book

In 1846, the [[Oregon Treaty]] divided the mainland at the [[49th parallel north]], and the southern portion of [[Vancouver Island]] south of this line was awarded to the British.&lt;ref name="Canado-American Treaties Text"&gt;{{cite web|year=2000 |url=http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/ca_us/en/cus.1818.15.en.html |title=Convention of Commerce between His Majesty and the United States of America.—Signed at London, 20th October 1818 |work=Canado-American Treaties |publisher=Université de Montréal |access-date=March 27, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411212640/http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/ca_us/en/cus.1818.15.en.html |archive-date=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washington Irving]], a prominent American writer with a European reputation, was approached by John Jacob Astor to mythologize the three-year reign of his Pacific Fur Company. ''[[Astoria (book)|Astoria]]'' (1835), written while Irving was Astor's guest, promoted the importance of the region in the American psyche.&lt;ref&gt;In his Introduction to the rambling work, Irving reports that Astor explicitly "expressed a regret that the true nature and extent of his enterprize&lt;!--enterprize in original--&gt;and its national character and importance had never been understood."&lt;/ref&gt; In Irving's words, the fur traders were "[[Sinbad]]s of the wilderness", and their venture was a staging point for the spread of American economic power into both the continental interior and outward in Pacific trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RdRKAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA105|title=Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society, Volume 9|date=1906|publisher=Kansas State Historical Society|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Oregon Territory]] grew and became increasingly more colonized by Americans, Astoria likewise grew as a [[Port|port city]] near the mouth of the great river that provided the easiest access to the interior. The first U.S. post office west of the Rocky Mountains was established in Astoria in 1847&lt;ref name="Oregon Sesquicentennial exhibit online version.pdf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pacificnorthwestpostalhistorysociety.org/Downloads/OregonTerritorialExhibit/Oregon%20Sesquitennial%20exhibit%20online%20version.pdf |title=Oregon Territorials – Oregon Sesquicentennial exhibit online version.pdf |year=2009 |publisher=Pacific Northwest Postal History Society |access-date=November 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220055006/http://pacificnorthwestpostalhistorysociety.org/Downloads/OregonTerritorialExhibit/Oregon%20Sesquitennial%20exhibit%20online%20version.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; and official state incorporation in 1876.&lt;ref name=incorp /&gt;

Astoria attracted a host of immigrants beginning in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century: [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] settlers, primarily [[Swedes]], Swedish speaking [[Finnish Americans|Finns]] and [[History of Chinese Americans|Chinese]] soon became larger parts of the population. The Nordic settlers mostly lived in Uniontown, near the present-day end of the Astoria–Megler Bridge, and took fishing jobs; the Chinese tended to do [[Salmon cannery|cannery]] work, and usually lived either downtown or in [[bunkhouse]]s near the canneries. By the late 1800s, 22% of Astoria's population was Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.loffe.net/emigration-mainmenu-59/1474-the-swedes-of-oregon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.opb.org/news/article/astoria_embraces_chinese_legacy/|title=Astoria Embraces Chinese Legacy|author=Chelsea Gorrow|newspaper= The Daily Astorian | date=April 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNwizCeblKgC&amp;pg=PA38|title = American Swedish Historical Museum: Yearbook 1946|isbn = 9781437950021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st centuries ===
In 1883, and again in [[1922 Astoria, Oregon fire|1922]], downtown Astoria was devastated by fire, partly because the buildings were constructed mostly of wood, a readily available material. The buildings were entirely raised off the marshy ground on wooden pilings. Even after the first fire, the same building format was used. In the second fire, flames spread quickly again, and the collapsing streets took out the water system.

[[File:Port of Astoria Oregon Signs.jpg|thumb|upright=0.82|alt=Port of Astoria|&lt;small style="font-size:92%;&gt;The Port of Astoria (2009).&lt;/small&gt;]]

Astoria has served as a port of entry for over a century and remains the trading center for the lower Columbia basin. It has long since been eclipsed in importance by [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], as economic hubs on the coast of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Astoria's economy centered on fishing, fish processing, and lumber. In 1945, about 30 canneries could be found along the Columbia River.

As the [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] resource diminished, canneries were closed. In 1974, the [[Bumble Bee Foods|Bumble Bee Seafoods]] corporation moved its headquarters out of Astoria and gradually reduced its presence until closing its last Astoria cannery in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=South Tongue Point Land Exchange and Marine Industrial Park Development Project, Clatsop County: Environmental Impact Statement&amp;nbsp;– "...&amp;nbsp;Bumblebee Seafood plant closed in 1982 (Powell, Goss &amp; Associates, 1990)."|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDQ3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT106|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wood industry|lumber industry]] likewise declined in the late 20th century. Astoria Plywood Mill, the city's largest employer, closed in 1989. The [[Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway]] discontinued service to Astoria in 1996, as it did not provide a large enough market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/lifestyle/3256316-153/going-goonie-in-astoria| first = John Gottberg | last= Anderson | title = Going "Goonie" in Astoria | newspaper = Bend Bulletin | date=June 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Astoria bridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.05|alt=Astoria–Megler Bridge|&lt;small style="font-size:92%;&gt;The Astoria–Megler Bridge.&lt;/small&gt;]]

From 1921 to 1966, a [[Astoria–Megler ferry|ferry route across the Columbia River]] connected Astoria with [[Pacific County, Washington]]. In 1966, the [[Astoria–Megler Bridge]] was opened. The bridge completed [[U.S. Route 101]] and linked Astoria with Washington on the opposite shore of the Columbia, replacing the ferry service.{{Sfn|Smith|1989|p=299}}

Today, tourism, Astoria's growing art scene, and light manufacturing are the main economic activities of the city. Logging and fishing persist, but at a fraction of their former levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://koin.com/2014/10/29/report-astoria-tops-west-coast-fishing-ports/ |title=Report: Astoria tops West Coast fishing ports |agency=Associated Press |date=October 29, 2014 |access-date=May 31, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808204432/http://koin.com/2014/10/29/report-astoria-tops-west-coast-fishing-ports/ |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1982 it has been a port of call for [[cruise ship]]s, after the city and port authority spent $10&amp;nbsp;million in pier improvements to accommodate these larger ships.

To avoid [[Mexico|Mexican]] ports of call during the [[2009 flu pandemic|Swine Flu outbreak of 2009]], many cruises were re-routed to include Astoria.

In addition to the replicated Fort Clatsop, another point of interest is the [[Astoria Column]], a tower {{convert|125|ft|m}} high, built atop Coxcomb Hill above the town. Its inner circular staircase allows visitors to climb to see a panoramic view of the town, the surrounding lands, and the Columbia flowing into the Pacific. The tower was built in 1926. Financing was provided by the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], seeking to encourage tourists, and [[Vincent Astor]], a great-grandson of [[John Jacob Astor]], in commemoration of the city's role in the family's business history and the region's early history.&lt;ref name=acolcch&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cbFXAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6859%2C293169 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |agency=Associated Press |title=Astoria Column, Coxcomb Hill |date=July 13, 1926 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tcatas&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=orVWAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6372%2C1096842 |newspaper=Eugene Guard |location=Oregon |title=The Column at Astoria |date=July 24, 1926 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, artistically inclined fishermen and women from [[Alaska]] and the Pacific Northwest have traveled to Astoria for the [[Fisher Poets Gathering]], where poets and singers tell their tales to honor the fishing industry and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=smithso&gt;{{cite magazine |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/rhyme-or-cut-bait-76082918/?c=y%3Fno-ist|title=Rhyme or Cut Bait When these fisher poets gather, nobody brags about the verse that got away|author=Sharon Boorstin|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine|date= June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular annual event is the Dark Arts Festival, which features music, art, dance, and demonstrations of craft such as blacksmithing and glassblowing, in combination with offerings of a large array of dark craft brews. Dark Arts Festival began as a small gathering at a community arts space. Now Fort George Brewery hosts the event, which draws hundreds of visitors and tour buses from Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.dailyastorian.com/multimedia/festival-of-dark-arts/collection_e559eb12-32fa-11e9-b34d-335c31cd3beb.html#1 |title=Festival of Dark Arts|author=Colin Murphey|newspaper=The Daily Astorian|date= February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baldassarre Cossa''' (c. 1370 – 22 December 1419) was [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] [[antipope]] '''John XXIII''' (1410–1415) during the [[Western Schism]]. The Catholic Church regards him as an [[antipope]], as he opposed [[Pope Gregory XII]] whom the Catholic Church now recognizes as the rightful successor of Saint Peter.

Cossa was born in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. In 1403, he served as a [[papal legate]] in Romagna. He participated in the [[Council of Pisa]] in 1408, which sought to end the Western Schism with the election of a third alternative pope. In 1410, he succeeded [[Antipope Alexander V]], taking the name John XXIII.  At the instigation of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, King of the Romans]], Pope John called the [[Council of Constance]] of 1413, which deposed John XXIII and Benedict XIII, accepted Gregory XII's resignation, and elected [[Pope Martin V]] to replace them, thus ending the schism. John XXIII was tried for various crimes, though later accounts question the veracity of those accusations.

== Early life ==
Baldassarre Cossa was born on the island of [[Procida]] in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to the family of Giovanni Cossa, lord of Procida. Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the [[Kingdom of Naples|Angevin-Neapolitan war]]. His two brothers were sentenced to death for [[piracy]] by [[Ladislaus of Naples]].&lt;ref name=mccabe&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph McCabe|title=Crises in the History of the Papacy|chapter=Chapter XI. John XXIII and the Great Schism|year=1916|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkX2JjO4V6sC&amp;pg=PA221|isbn=978-0-7661-7904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied law at the [[University of Bologna]] and obtained doctorates in both civil and canon law.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2011| loc=Chapter 7}} Probably at the prompting of his family, in 1392 he entered the service of [[Pope Boniface IX]], first working in Bologna and then in Rome. (The [[Western Schism]] had begun in 1378, and there were two competing popes at the time, one in Avignon supported by France and Spain, and one in Rome, supported by most of Italy, Germany and England.) In 1386 he is listed as canon of the cathedral of Bologna. In 1396, he became archdeacon in Bologna. He became [[cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal deacon|Cardinal deacon]] of Saint Eustachius in 1402 and [[Papal legate]] in [[Romagna]] in 1403. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] describes Cossa as "utterly worldly-minded, ambitious, crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral, a good soldier but no churchman".&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08434a.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. "John XXIII." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Cossa also had some links with local robber bands, which were often used to intimidate his rivals and attack carriages. These connections added to his influence and power in the region.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2011| p=158}}

== Role in the Western Schism ==

=== Council of Pisa ===
Cardinal Cossa was one of the seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] who, in May 1408, withdrew their allegiance from [[Pope Gregory XII]], stating that he had broken his solemn oath not to create new cardinals without consulting them in advance.  In company with those cardinals who had been following [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, they convened the [[Council of Pisa]], of which Cossa became a leading figure. The aim of the council was to end the schism; to this end they deposed both Gregory XII and Benedict XIII and elected a new pope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] in 1409.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; Gregory and Benedict ignored this decision, however, so that there were now three simultaneous claimants to the [[papacy]].

=== Election to the papacy ===
Alexander V died soon after, and on 25 May 1410 Cossa was consecrated a bishop, taking the name John XXIII. He had become an [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained priest]] only one day earlier. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]]; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector Palatine]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, R.W. (1980) ''Donatello &amp; Michelozzo''. London: Harvey Miller. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; John XXIII made the [[Medici Bank]] the bank of the papacy, contributing considerably to the family's wealth and prestige.&lt;ref name=mediateca&gt;[http://www.palazzo-medici.it/mediateca/en/Scheda_Baldassarre_Cossa "Popes and Prelates", Mediateca di Palazzo Medici]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main enemy of John was [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who protected Gregory XII in Rome. Following his election as pope, John spent a year in Bologna and then joined forces with [[Louis II of Anjou]] to march against Ladislaus. An initial victory proved short-lived and Ladislaus retook Rome in May 1413, forcing John to flee to Florence.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; In Florence he met [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of the Romans. Sigismund wanted to end the schism and urged John to call a general council. John did so with hesitation, at first trying to have the council held in Italy (rather than in a German [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], as Sigismund wanted). The [[Council of Constance]] was convened on 30 October 1413. During the third session, rival [[Pope Gregory XII]] authorized the council as well. The council resolved that all three popes should abdicate and a new pope be elected.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1419.htm Miranda, Salvador. "Cossa, Baldassare", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flight from the Council of Constance ===
In March, John escaped from Constance disguised as a postman.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; According to the Klingenberger Chronicle, written by a noble client of [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]], John XXIII travelled down the Rhine to Schaffhausen in a boat, while Frederick accompanied him with a small band of men on horseback. There was a huge outcry in Constance when it was discovered that John had fled, and Sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the Schism. The King of the Romans issued orders to all the powers on the Upper Rhine and in Swabia stating that he had declared Frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit. In due course this led to a great deal of political upheaval and many Austrian losses in the region, notably in [[Aargau]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]].

In the meantime, AntiPope John XXIII and Frederick fled further downriver along the Rhine to the town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], which recognised the duke of Austria as its lord. There Sigismund's lieutenant [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]] caught up with them. He convinced Frederick that he stood to lose too much by harbouring the fugitive pope, and the Austrian duke agreed to give himself and John up and return to Constance.&lt;ref&gt;Brandmüller, Walter. ''Das Konzil von Konstanz'', 1414–1418 (Paderborn, 1991){{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deposition ===
During his absence John was deposed by the council, and upon his return he was tried for heresy, simony, schism and immorality, and found guilty on all counts. [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] wrote, "The more scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of Christ was accused only of [[piracy]], [[rape]], sodomy, murder and [[incest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', New York: The Heritage Press, 1946, vol. 3, p. 2417&lt;/ref&gt; John was given over to [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]], who imprisoned him for several months in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Mannheim]].
The last remaining claimant in Avignon, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], refused to resign and was excommunicated. [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] was elected as new pope in 1417.

== Death and burial ==
[[File:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]].]]

Cossa was again imprisoned in Germany. He was freed in 1418 after a heavy ransom was paid by the Medici.&lt;ref name=mediateca/&gt; He went to Florence, where he submitted to Martin V, who made him [[Cardinal Bishop of Frascati]]. Cossa died only a few months later.

The Medici oversaw the construction of [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII|his magnificent tomb]] by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] in the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Battistero di San Giovanni]] in Florence. Pope Martin V protested in vain against the inscription on the sarcophagus: "John the former pope".

J.P. Kirsch remarks that "Undeniably secular and ambitious, his moral life was not above reproach, and his unscrupulous methods in no wise accorded with the requirements of his high office&amp;nbsp;... the heinous crimes of which his opponents in the council accused him were certainly gravely exaggerated."&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; One historian concluded that John was "a great man in temporal things, but a complete failure and worthless in spiritual things".&lt;ref name=mccabe/&gt;

==Fictional depictions==
John is portrayed by [[Steven Waddington]] in the 2016 television series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medici: Masters of Florence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5057130/|website=Internet Movie Database|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John is also a main character in ''[[A Trembling Upon Rome]]'' by [[Richard Condon]].

The 1932 thriller 'Safe Custody' by [[Dornford Yates]], references John. Listing the members of an objectionable family, a character in the story says:

"Then we come to his nephew—a promising lad of fifteen. He lies, steals, smells, assaults the servants and abuses any animal which he is satisfied will not retaliate. If Gibbon may be believed, Pope John the Twenty-third as a stripling must have resembled him".

Russian writer Dmitry Balashov wrote a novel "Baltazar Kossa" (Бальтазар Косса).

== Numbering issues ==
{{main|Pope John (numbering)}}
He should not be confused with [[Pope John XXIII]] of the twentieth century. When [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] was elected pope in 1958, there was some confusion as to whether he would be ''John XXIII'' or ''John XXIV''; he then declared that he was John XXIII to put this question to rest. There was no [[Pope John XX|John XX]]; this is why Gibbon refers to the antipope John as John XXII.

Atlanta was originally founded as the terminus of a major state-sponsored railroad. With rapid expansion, however, it soon became the convergence point among multiple railroads, spurring its rapid growth. The city's name derives from that of the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]]'s local depot, signifying the town's growing reputation as a transportation hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta|url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/atlanta#Population-Patterns|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], the city was almost entirely burned to the ground in [[General William T. Sherman]]'s famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. However, the city rose from its ashes and quickly became a national center of commerce and the unofficial capital of the "[[New South]]". During the 1950s and 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the [[civil rights movement]], with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and many other locals playing major roles in the movement's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/jun/28/al-roker/whos-right-cities-lay-claim-civil-rights-cradle-ma/|title=Who's right?

===Native American settlements===
For thousands of years prior to the arrival of European settlers in north Georgia, the indigenous [[Creek (people)|Creek people]] and their ancestors inhabited the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chieftainstrail.com/ |title=Northwest Georgia's Native American History |publisher=Chieftains Trail |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standing Peachtree]], a Creek village where [[Peachtree Creek]] flows into the [[Chattahoochee River]], was the closest Native American settlement to what is now Atlanta.&lt;ref name=buckhead&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buckhead.net/history/fort-peachtree/index.html|title=Fort Peachtree | website=Buckhead.net | access-date=February 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the early 19th century, European Americans systematically encroached on the Creek of northern Georgia, forcing them out of the area from 1802 to 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/history/indianla.html |title=Land Cessions of American Indians in Georgia |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Creek were forced to leave the area in 1821, under [[Indian Removal]] by the federal government,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/CitiesCounties/Counties&amp;id=h-2335 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia, "Fulton County" |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and European American settlers arrived the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1403 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia, "DeKalb County" |website=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=June 19, 2008 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western and Atlantic Railroad===
[[File:Marietta-Street-Atlanta.jpg|thumb|left|Marietta Street, 1864]]

In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the Western and Atlantic Railroad in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name="W&amp;ARR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad|work=About North Georgia|publisher=Golden Ink|url=http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html|access-date=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial route was to run southward from [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] to a terminus east of the [[Chattahoochee River]], which would be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as ''Terminus'', and later ''Thrasherville'', after a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the area.&lt;ref name="ThrashervilleHistoricalMarker"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thrasherville|url=http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/fulton/thrasherville|website=Georgia Info|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed ''[[Marthasville, Georgia|Marthasville]]'' to honor Governor [[Wilson Lumpkin|Wilson Lumpkin's]] daughter Martha. Later, [[J. Edgar Thomson]], Chief Engineer of the [[Georgia Railroad]], suggested the town be renamed ''Atlanta''.&lt;ref name="NGEAtlanta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambrose|first1=Andy|title=Atlanta|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/atlanta#Population-Patterns|website=New Georgia Encyclopedia|publisher=Georgia Humanities Council|access-date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/date/December_29|title=Georgia History Timeline Chronology for December&amp;nbsp;29|publisher=Our Georgia History|access-date=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War===

By 1860, Atlanta's population had grown to 9,554.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Storey|first=Steve|title=Atlanta &amp; West Point Railroad|publisher=Georgia's Railroad History &amp; Heritage|url=http://railga.com/atlwp.html|access-date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta Old and New: 1848 to 1868|work=Roadside Georgia|publisher=Golden Ink|url=http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/atlanta02.html|access-date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]], the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a strategic hub for the distribution of military supplies.

In 1864, the [[Union Army]] moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, culminating with the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] decided to retreat from Atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun (politician, born 1811)|James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, Sherman prepared for the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] by ordering the destruction of Atlanta's remaining military assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.civilwarlibrary.org/sherman-s-march-chronology.html|title=Sherman's March Chronology|website=www.civilwarlibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebuilding the city===
After the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. The work attracted many new residents. Due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, the [[List of U.S. state historical capitals|state capital]] was moved from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] to Atlanta in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Edwin L.|title=The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities|publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia|url=http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763|access-date=November 13, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm|archive-date=October 9, 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880 Census, Atlanta had surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.

Beginning in the 1880s, [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "[[New South]]" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now [[History of Georgia Tech|Georgia Tech]]) and the [[Atlanta University Center]], a consortium of [[historically black colleges]] made up of units for men and women, had established Atlanta as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/06/08/102515577.pdf|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor ...|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 8, 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[File:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumb|left|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles.]]

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. The city's skyline grew taller with the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable]], [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron]], [[J. Mack Robinson College of Business Administration Building|Empire]], and [[Candler Building (Atlanta)|Candler]] buildings. [[Sweet Auburn]] emerged as a center of black commerce. The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the [[Atlanta Race Riot]] of 1906, when whites attacked blacks, leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured, with extensive damage in black neighborhoods. In 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish-American factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. He was sentenced to death but the governor commuted his sentence to life. An enraged and organized [[Lynching|lynch mob]] took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]]. The Jewish community in Atlanta and across the country were horrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jewish Community of Atlanta|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/atlanta|website=Beit Hatfutsot Open Databases Project|publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klapper, Melissa, R., PhD.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the [[premiere]] of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's [[Margaret Mitchell]]. The gala event at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]] was attended by the film's legendary producer, [[David O. Selznick]], and the film's stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]], but Oscar winner [[Hattie McDaniel]], an African-American actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/Atlanta_Premiere_of_Gone_With_The_Wind|title=Atlanta Premiere of Gone with the Wind|publisher=Ngeorgia.com|access-date=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan area's growth===
Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during [[World War II]] due to the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases. The defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues, resulting in rapid population and economic growth. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system, supported by federal subsidies, allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.&lt;ref name=NGEAtlanta/&gt; [[Georgia Tech]]'s president [[Blake R Van Leer]] played an important role with a goal of making Atlanta the "[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] of the South.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40581436 | title=Engineering the New South: Georgia Tech, 1885–1985 | journal=The Georgia Historical Quarterly | jstor=40581436 | access-date=2020-11-29| last1=Hair | first1=William I. | year=1985 | volume=69 | issue=4 | pages=509–517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946 Georgia Tech secured about $240,000 annually in sponsored research and purchased an [[electron microscope]] for $13,000 ({{Inflation|US|13000|1946|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}), the first such instrument in the [[Southeastern United States]] and one of few in the United States at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://smartech.gatech.edu/handle/1853/26051|title=New Microscope For Experiment Installed at Tech|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1946-01-19|access-date=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Research Building was expanded, and a $300,000 ({{Inflation|US|300000|1947|r=-6|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}) [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] [[Network analyzer (AC power)|A-C network calculator]] was given to Georgia Tech by [[Georgia Power]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/gtri75/our-75-years/ees-installs-"electro-mechanical-brain"|title=EES Installs "Electro-Mechanical Brain"|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Research Institute]]|access-date=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Van Leer assisted with helping Lockheed establish a [[research and development]] and production line in Marietta. Later in 1955 he helped set up a committee to assist with establishing a nuclear research facility, which would later become the [[Neely Nuclear Research Center]]. Van Leer also co-founded [[Southern Polytechnic State University]] now known as [[Kennesaw State University]] to help meet the need for technicians after the war.&lt;ref&gt;W. L.

===Civil Rights Movement===
African-American veterans returned from World War II seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism. In exchange for support by that portion of the black community that could vote, in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight African-American police officers in the city. Much controversy preceded the [[1956 Sugar Bowl]], when the [[1955 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pitt Panthers]], with African-American fullback [[Bobby Grier (Pittsburgh Panthers)|Bobby Grier]] on the roster, met the [[1955 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]].&lt;ref name=fcflu&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cs9RAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4796%2C5131560 |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |last=Sell |first=Jack |title=Panthers defeat flu; face Ga.

In the 1960s, Atlanta became a major organizing center of the [[civil rights movement]], with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Ralph David Abernathy]], and students from Atlanta's [[historically black colleges and universities]] playing major roles in the movement's leadership. While Atlanta in the postwar years had relatively minimal racial strife compared to other cities, blacks were limited by discrimination, segregation, and continued [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of most voters.&lt;ref name="kruse"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c5763Zgu4_oC&amp;lpg=PP1|title=White Flight: Atlanta and the Making of Modern Conservatism|author=Kevin Michael Kruse|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=February 1, 2008|isbn=978-0-691-09260-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, the city attempted to thwart [[blockbusting]] by realtors by erecting road barriers in [[Cascade Heights]], &lt;!-- How was this supposed to work? --&gt;countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the "city too busy to hate".&lt;ref name="kruse"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874660,00.html|title="The South: Divided City", ''Time'' magazine, January 18, 1961|work=TIME|date=January 18, 1963|access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996 Summer Olympic Games===
[[File:JO Atlanta 1996 - Drapeau.jpg|thumb|The Olympic flag waves at the 1996 games.|alt=]]
Atlanta was selected as the site for the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games]]. Following the [[Bids for the 1996 Summer Olympics|announcement]], the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure; however, for the first time, none of the $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion cost of the games was governmentally funded. While the games experienced transportation and accommodation problems and, despite extra security precautions, there was the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Olympic Games Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., 1996|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-249564/Olympic-Games|access-date=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the spectacle was a watershed event in Atlanta's history. For the first time in Olympic history, every one of the record 197 national Olympic committees invited to compete sent athletes, sending more than 10,000 contestants participating in a record 271 events. The related projects such as [[Atlanta's Olympic Legacy Program]] and civic effort initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

===2000 to present===
During the 2000s, Atlanta underwent a profound physical, [[human culture|cultural]], and [[demographics|demographic]] transformation. As some of the black middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs, a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other areas of the country, who contributed to changes in the city's demographics. African Americans made up a decreasing portion of the population, from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010.&lt;ref name="spelman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spelman.edu/academics/enrichment/census/pdf/cicnewsletterjan2009vs2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208211609/http://www.spelman.edu/academics/enrichment/census/pdf/cicnewsletterjan2009vs2.pdf |archive-date=December 8, 2011 |title=The U.S. Census in the Past and Present|author=Tiffany Davis, B.A.|publisher=Spelman College|date=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the city's black population decreased by 31,678.&lt;ref name="blogs.ajc.com"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim |last=Galloway |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2011/03/23/a-census-speeds-atlanta-toward-racially-neutral-ground/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140913094510/http://blogs.ajc.com/political-insider-jim-galloway/2011/03/23/a-census-speeds-atlanta-toward-racially-neutral-ground/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2014 |title=A census speeds Atlanta toward racially neutral ground |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=March 23, 2011 |access-date=July 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-031106"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times |first=Shaila |last=Dewan |date=March 11, 2006 |title=Gentrification Changing Face of New Atlanta |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/11/national/11atlanta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the city's demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the [[Intown Atlanta|three-mile radius]] surrounding [[Downtown Atlanta]] gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 and holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2011-04-01-1Ayoungrestless01_ST_N.htm |work=USA Today |title=Urban centers draw more young, educated adults |date=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was similar to the tendency in other cities for young, college educated, single or married couples to live in downtown areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider |first=Craig |url=http://www.atlantadowntown.com/article/young-professionals-lead-surge-of-intown-living |title=Young professionals lead surge of intown living |newspaper=ajc.com |date=April 13, 2011 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-fifths of previous public housing residents attained new housing in such units; the remainder received vouchers to be used at other units, including in suburbs. At the same time, in an effort to change the culture of those receiving subsidized housing, the AHA imposed a requirement for such residents to work (or be enrolled in a genuine, limited-time training program). It is virtually the only housing authority to have created this requirement. To prevent problems, the AHA also gave authority to management of the mixed-income or voucher units to evict tenants who did not comply with the work requirement or who caused behavior problems.&lt;ref name="husock"/&gt;

Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally "southern" because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class, such as [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] or [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. Because of its later development, many of the city's landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the Northeast or Midwest, as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles.&lt;ref name="Gournay"&gt;{{cite book|title=AIA Guide to the Architecture of Atlanta|last=Gournay|first=Isabelle|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn = 0820314501|year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Midtown Atlanta.JPG|thumb|The skyline of Midtown (viewed from [[Piedmont Park]]) emerged with the construction of modernist [[Colony Square]] in 1972.]]

During the late twentieth century, Atlanta embraced the global trend of [[modern architecture]], especially for commercial and institutional structures. Examples include the [[State of Georgia Building]] built in 1966, and the [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]] in 1982. Many of the most notable examples from this period were designed by world renowned Atlanta architect [[John C. Portman Jr.|John Portman]]. Most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by Portman during this period, including the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]] and the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis]]. In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style, displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as [[One Atlantic Center]] (1987), [[191 Peachtree Tower]] (1991), and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta]] (1992). Also completed during the era is the Portman-designed [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]] built in 1992. At {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}, it is the tallest building in the city and the 14th-tallest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World's Tallest Buildings|publisher=Infoplease |access-date=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's embrace of modern architecture has often translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of many notable architectural landmarks. These include the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable Building]] (1892–1971), [[Terminal Station (Atlanta)|Terminal Station]] (1905–1972), and the [[Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System#The Carnegie Library|Carnegie Library]] (1902–1977).&lt;ref name="Guardian preservation"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Mead |first1=Nick |title=The lost city of Atlanta |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/23/lost-city-of-atlanta-historic-building-parking-lot |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News &amp; Media Limited |access-date=May 16, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]], now a cultural icon of the city, would have met the same fate if not for a grassroots effort to save it.&lt;ref name="Gournay"/&gt; More recently, preservationists may have made some inroads. For example, in 2016 activists convinced the Atlanta City Council not to demolish the Atlanta-Fulton Central Library, the last building designed by noted architect [[Marcel Breuer]].&lt;ref name="Central Library Saved"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jason |first1=Sayer |title=Marcel Breuer's Central Library in Atlanta to be renovated and NOT demolished |url=https://archpaper.com/2016/07/marcel-breuer-central-library-atlanta-saved/ |access-date=May 16, 2020 |work=The Architect's Newspaper |publisher=The Architect's Newspaper, LLC |date=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area, much of it occupied by government entities. Downtown is home to the city's sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions. [[Midtown Atlanta]] is the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of many of the region's law firms.

In southwest Atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs, including the historic [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]], while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout. These include [[Collier Heights]] and [[Cascade Heights]], home to much of the city's affluent African-American population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/atlanta-mayors-race-words-181340.html|title=Atlanta mayor's race: Words of support |newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=November 1, 2009|access-date=October 28, 2014 |author1=Stirgus, Eric |author2=Torpy, Bill | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202074026/http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/atlanta-mayors-race-words-181340.html|archive-date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKXsm19fBpkC&amp;pg=PA38|title="The Black Middle Class: Where It Lives", ''Ebony'', August 1987|access-date=October 28, 2014|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|date=August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2004-06-27/business/0406270223_1_black-homeowners-neighborhoods-home-buyers/2|title=Atlanta's minorities see dramatic rise in homeownership| date= June 27, 2004|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard and to the north of Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, including those neighborhoods remote to downtown, such as Riverside, Bolton and Whittier Mill.

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The [[gentrification of Atlanta]] has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had declined and suffered the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through the city's east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]]. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. New development post-2000 has been aided by the [[Atlanta Housing Authority]]'s eradication of the city's public housing. As noted above, it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing, requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units. It has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas.&lt;ref name="husock"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_4_atlanta-public-housing.html |title=Atlanta's Public-Housing Revolution |last=Husock |first=Howard |work=City Journal |date=Autumn 2010|access-date=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the Beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers |first=Benjamin |url=https://www.citylab.com/equity/2017/11/putting-the-brakes-on-runaway-gentrification-in-atlanta/545555/ |title=Putting the Brakes on Runaway Gentrification in Atlanta |work=[[CityLab (web magazine)|CityLab]] |date=November 10, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religion in Atlanta]], while historically centered on [[Protestant Christianity]], now encompasses many faiths, as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population.

Metro Atlanta also has numerous ethnic or national Christian congregations, including Korean and Indian churches. The larger non-Christian faiths are [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Hinduism]].

Atlanta started as a railroad town, and [[logistics]] has been a major component of the city's economy to this day. Atlanta serves as an important rail junction and contains major [[classification yard]]s for [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]. Since its construction in the 1950s, [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] has served as a key engine of the city's economic growth.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Frederick |title=Atlanta Rising |year=1996 |publisher=Longstreet Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=1-56352-296-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delta Air Lines, the city's largest employer and the metro area's third-largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson, and it has helped make it the [[world's busiest airport]], in terms of both passenger traffic and aircraft operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce]] |title = Atlanta's top employers, 2006 |url=http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf |access-date=August 8, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225123824/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf |archive-date = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the airport, Atlanta has been also a hub for diplomatic missions; {{As of|2017|lc=y}}, the city contains [[List of diplomatic missions in Atlanta|26 consulates general]], the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the US.&lt;ref name="Consulates"&gt;{{cite web|title=CONSULAR OFFICES|url=http://www.georgia.org/business-resources/international-relations/consular-offices/|website=Georgia.org|publisher=Georgia Department of Economic Development|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207112711/http://www.georgia.org/business-resources/international-relations/consular-offices/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasting is also an important aspect of Atlanta's economy. In the 1980s, media mogul [[Ted Turner]] founded the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) and the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (TBS) in the city. Around the same time, [[Cox Enterprises]], now the nation's third-largest [[cable television]] service and the publisher of over a dozen American newspapers, moved its headquarters to the city.&lt;ref name="CoxHQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atlanta Headquarters|url=https://www.cox.com/aboutus/headquarters.html|website=cox.com|publisher=Cox Communications, Inc.|access-date=February 6, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128174133/https://www.cox.com/aboutus/headquarters.html|archive-date=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Weather Channel]] is also based just outside of the city in suburban [[Cobb County]].[[File:CNN Atlanta Newsroom.jpg|thumb|The CNN newsroom|alt=]]

[[Information technology]] (IT) has become an increasingly important part of Atlanta's economic output, earning the city the nickname the "[[Silicon peach]]". {{As of|2013}}, Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of IT jobs in the US, numbering 85,000+. The city is also ranked as the sixth fastest-growing for IT jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs.

==Culture==
[[File:Museum oF Design Atlanta.jpg|thumb|[[Museum of Design Atlanta|The Museum of Design Atlanta]] (MODA)]]

Atlanta is noted for its lack of [[Southern United States|Southern]] culture. This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., in addition to many recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the U.S.]] who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;18.6% of City of Atlanta born in US outside South and 8.0% foreign born (compare to 7.1%/3.0% for Macon, GA and 7.7%/3.2% for Birmingham, AL): [https://www.census.gov PLACE OF BIRTH BY CITIZENSHIP STATUS, 2010 ACS 1-year estimates, U.S. Census U.S. Census website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garner |first1=Marcus K. |last2=Schneider |first2=Craig |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |title=Foreign-born population continues to grow in metro Atlanta |newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=December 18, 2010 |access-date=June 27, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221101715/http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |archive-date=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it is mostly a footnote to one of the nation's most cosmopolitan cities. This unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of Midtown, the quirky neighborhoods on the city's [[Eastside (Atlanta)|eastside]], and the multi-ethnic enclaves found along [[Buford Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html |title=Introduction in Atlanta at Frommer's |publisher=Frommers.com |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts and theater===
{{Main|Arts in Atlanta}}
Atlanta is one of few United States cities with permanent, professional, and resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera ([[Atlanta Opera]]), ballet ([[Atlanta Ballet]]), orchestral music ([[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]]), and theater (the [[Alliance Theatre]]). Atlanta attracts many touring Broadway acts, concerts, shows, and exhibitions catering to a variety of interests. Atlanta's performing arts district is concentrated in [[Midtown Atlanta]] at the [[Woodruff Arts Center]], which is home to the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Alliance Theatre]].

Atlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the city's history. Beginning as early as the 1920s, Atlanta emerged as a center for [[country music]], which was brought to the city by migrants from [[Appalachia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wayne W.

The city was also a center for [[Southern rock]] during its 1970s heyday: the [[Allman Brothers Band]]'s hit instrumental "[[Hot 'Lanta]]" is an ode to the city, while [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s famous live rendition of "[[Free Bird]]" was recorded at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]] in 1976, with lead singer [[Ronnie Van Zant]] directing the band to "play it pretty for Atlanta".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rock's Top Southern Sound Viewed as Lynyrd Skynyrd |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7MtVAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=lynyrd%20skynyrd%20fox%20theatre&amp;pg=6799%2C459278 |newspaper=The Robesonian |location=Lumberton, N.C. |date=November 7, 1976 |access-date=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Atlanta had an active [[punk rock]] scene centered on two of the city's music venues, [[688 Club]] and the Metroplex, and Atlanta famously played host to the [[Sex Pistols]]' first U.S. show, which was performed at the Great Southeastern Music Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clatl.com/atlanta/atlanta-punk-a-reunion-for-688-and-metroplex/Content?oid=1275596 |title= Atlanta punk!

The city is home to professional franchises for four major team sports: the [[Atlanta Braves]] of [[Major League Baseball]], the [[Atlanta Hawks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], the [[Atlanta Falcons]] of the [[National Football League]], and [[Atlanta United FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. In addition, many of the city's universities participate in collegiate sports. The city also regularly hosts international, professional, and collegiate sporting events.

The Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966. Originally established as the [[Boston]] Red Stockings in 1871, they are the oldest continually operating professional sports franchise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stirgus|first1=Eric|title=Braves go back, back, back|url=http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2010/dec/14/atlanta-braves/braves-go-back-back-back/|website=Politifact|access-date=October 13, 2016|date=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braves won the [[World Series]] in 1995, during an unprecedented run of 14 straight divisional championships from 1991 to 2005.&lt;ref name="braves_oldest_team"&gt;"[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp The Story of the Braves]."

The city is home to the [[Atlanta Dogwood Festival]], an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native [[Cornus (genus)|dogwoods]] are in bloom. The nickname is factually accurate, as vegetation covers 47.9% of the city as of 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://saportareport.com/atlantas-urban-tree-canopy-leads-nation-trees-not-protected/ |title=Atlanta's urban tree canopy leads the nation; but most trees are not protected|publisher=Saporta Report |first=Maria |last=Saporta |date=May 7, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the highest among all major American cities, and well above the national average of 27%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deeproot.com/blog/blog-entries/tree-cover-how-does-your-city-measure-up |title=Tree Cover % – How Does Your City Measure Up? |publisher=DeepRoot Blog |date=April 25, 2010 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' in naming Atlanta a "Place of a Lifetime".&lt;ref name=inside-access/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/city-guides/atlanta-georgia/ |title=Atlanta, Georgia – National Geographic's Ultimate City Guides |publisher=National Geographic Society |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treenextdoor.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=148&amp;Itemid=179 |title=Changes in Atlanta's Tree Canopy |publisher=Treenextdoor.org |date=October 30, 2008 |access-date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizations and the city government are addressing the problem.

The [[Federal city]] of '''Bonn''' ({{IPA-de|bɔn|-|De-Bonn.ogg}} {{lang-lat|Bonna}}) is a [[city]] on the banks of the [[Rhine]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with a population of over 300,000. About {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Cologne]], Bonn is in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. It is famously known as the birthplace of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in 1770 as well as the  [[capital city]] of [[West Germany]] until 1990.

Founded in the 1st century BC as the Roman settlement [[Germania Inferior]], Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the [[Electorate of Cologne]], and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]]. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the [[Capital of Germany|capital]] of [[West Germany]], and Germany's present constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], was declared in the city in 1949. The era when Bonn served as the capital of West Germany is referred to by historians as the ''Bonn Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bonn Republic: West German Democracy, 1945–1990|author=Anthony James Nicholls|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1997|isbn=9780582492318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSvYAAAAIAAJ|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government – but no longer capital – of [[German reunification|reunited Germany]].

Due to a political compromise ([[Berlin-Bonn Act]]) following the reunification, the German federal government maintains a substantial presence in Bonn. Roughly a third of all ministerial jobs are located in Bonn {{as of|2019|lc=y}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bonn-berlin-gesetz-101.html|title=Bonn-Berlin-Gesetz: Dieselbe Prozedur wie jedes Jahr|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de|access-date=26 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the city is considered a second, unofficial, [[Capital of Germany|capital]] of the country.&lt;ref name="Cowell"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/world/europe/24berlin.html |title=In Germany's Capitals, Cold War Memories and Imperial Ghosts | work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Alan |last=Cowell |date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonn is the secondary seat of the [[President of Germany|President]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]] and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. The title of Federal City ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesstadt}}) reflects its important political status within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchiv.bundestag.de/archive/2008/0912/bau_kunst/debatte/bd_antr2.html|title=Deutscher Bundestag: Berlin-Debatte / Antrag Vollendung der Einheit Deutschlands, Drucksache 12/815|last=Bundestag|first=Deutscher|website=webarchiv.bundestag.de|language=de|access-date=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The headquarters of [[Deutsche Post DHL]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]], both [[DAX]]-listed corporations, are in Bonn. The city is home to the [[University of Bonn]] and a total of 20 United Nations institutions, the highest number in all of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/aussenpolitik/internationale-organisationen/uno/03-uno-in-deutschland/-/205650|title=Übersicht: Die Vereinten Nationen (VN) in Deutschland|last=Amt|first=Auswärtiges|website=Auswärtiges Amt|language=de|access-date=6 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These institutions include the headquarters for Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Secretariat of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the UN Volunteers programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unbonn.org/organizations|title=UNBonn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

{{wide image|General view over bonn.jpg|900px|View over central Bonn as seen from the Stadthaus, including the [[Siebengebirge]], a hill range on the east bank of the [[Middle Rhine]].|5=center}}

===Topography===
Situated in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area with over 11 million inhabitants, Bonn lies within the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], on the border with [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Spanning an area of more {{convert|141.2|km2|0|abbr=on}} on both sides of the river [[Rhine]], almost three-quarters of the city lies on the river's left bank.

To the south and to the west, Bonn is bordering the [[Eifel]] region which encompasses the [[Rhineland Nature Park]]. To the north, Bonn borders the [[Cologne Lowland]]. Natural borders are constituted by the river [[Sieg]] to the north-east and by the [[Siebengebirge]] (also known as the Seven Hills) to the east. The largest extension of the city in north–south dimensions is {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in west–east dimensions. The city borders have a total length of {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}}. The geographical centre of Bonn is the Bundeskanzlerplatz ''(Chancellor Square)'' in Bonn-Gronau.

=== Administration ===
The [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is divided into five [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk}}), and Bonn is part of the [[Regierungsbezirk Köln|governmental district of Cologne]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk Köln}}). Within this governmental district, the city of Bonn is an [[List of districts of Germany|urban district]] in its own right. The urban district of Bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts ({{lang-de|link=no|Stadtbezirk}}). These are Bonn, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Bonn-Beuel and Bonn-Hardtberg.
In 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and Beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.

== History ==

===Founding and Roman times===
{{see also|Timeline of Bonn}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
[[File:2008-12-25 Bonn Sterntor.jpg|left|thumb|The ''{{lang|de|Sterntor}}'', originally built around 1244, is a gate reconstructed on the remnants of the medieval city wall.]]
The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 12 BC, the [[Roman army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, "Bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]], the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, "Fort Bonn". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-5th century. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] kings until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The Sterntor (''star gate'') in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the "1st", i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].

[[File:Altes Rathaus Bonn.jpg|thumb|The ''Altes Rathaus'' (old town hall) as seen from the central market square. It was built in 1737 in [[Rococo]]-style.]]The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of Cologne and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne–Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, ''Bonna'', grew into a sizeable Roman town. Bonn is shown on the 4th century [[Peutinger Map]].

In [[late antiquity]], much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Franks|Franci]] chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from [[Saint Boniface]] via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*Bonnifatia'', but this proved to be a myth.

=== Middle Ages and Early Modern times ===
[[File:University bonn at night.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1818, the [[University of Bonn]] counts [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] among its alumni.]]
Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|Siege of Bonn]] in 1689. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Max Franz]] (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].

In 1794, the city was seized by French troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

===20th century and the "Bonn Republic"===
{{See also|Berlin-Bonn Act|Decision on the Capital of Germany}}

During the [[Second World War]], Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] captured the city during the battle of 8–9 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946|edition=Revised |year=2006|publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfDfAQAACAAJ|isbn=9780811701570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013859-0009, Bonn, Staatsbesuch Präsident Charles de Gaulle.jpg|left|thumb|French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] on state visit to Bonn (1962), the capital of [[West Germany]] until [[German reunification]].]]

[[Aftermath of World War II|After]] the Second World War, Bonn was in the British zone of occupation. Following the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former Cologne Mayor and a native of that area, Bonn became the ''de facto'' capital, officially designated the "temporary seat of the Federal institutions," of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. However, the Bundestag, seated in Bonn's [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus]], affirmed [[Berlin]]'s status as the German capital. Bonn was chosen as the provisional capital and seat of government despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. Bonn was chosen because Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in West Germany for reunification.

In 1949, the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] in Bonn drafted and adopted the current German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. As the political centre of West Germany, Bonn saw six [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellors]] and six [[President of Germany|Presidents]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn's time as the capital of West Germany is commonly referred to as the ''Bonn Republic,'' in contrast to the ''Berlin Republic'' which followed reunification in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schleichende Wende. Diskurse von Nation und Erinnerung bei der Konstituierung der Berliner Republik|last=Caborn|first=Joannah|language=de|publisher={{ill|Unrast Verlag|de}}|year=2006|isbn=9783897717398|pages=12|via=[[Google Books]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjNoAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonn in the "Berlin Republic"===
[[File:Villa Hammerschmidt Bonn Seite Adenauerallee 20080831.jpg|left|thumb|Between 1950 and 1994, [[Hammerschmidt Villa|Villa Hammerschmidt]] was the primary official residence of the [[President of Germany]]. Today it serves as the President's secondary residence.]]
[[German reunification]] in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision, however, did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn – a situation roughly analogous to that of the [[Netherlands]], where [[Amsterdam]] is the capital but [[The Hague]] is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and more ominously with [[Nazi Germany]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to [[Brussels]], headquarters of the [[European Economic Community]]. Former chancellor and mayor of [[West Berlin]] [[Willy Brandt]] caused considerable offence to the Western Allies during the debate by stating that France would not have kept the seat of government at [[Vichy France|Vichy]] after Liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o36GDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Willy+Brandt++France+Vichy+capital&amp;pg=PA149|title=Willy Brandt: a Political Biography|author=Barbara Marshall|date=18 December 1996|publisher=Springer|page=149|isbn=9780230390096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heated debate that [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|resulted]] was settled by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338–320,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20110615/35655|title=Bonn to Berlin move still controversial|work=The Local|date=15 June 2011|access-date=1 December 2020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin. The vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring Bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationalatlas aktuell|url=http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|website=Hauptstadtbeschluss|author=Sebastian Lentz|date=17 June 2011|access-date=20 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331093254/http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|archive-date=31 March 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laux|first=Hans-Dieter|title=Berlin oder Bonn? Geographische Aspekte eine Parlamentsentscheidung|journal=Geographische Rundschau|volume=43|issue=12|pages=740–743|year=1991|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also broke along generational lines as well; older legislators with memories of Berlin's past glory favoured Berlin, while younger legislators favoured Bonn. Ultimately, the votes of the [[New states of Germany#Culture|eastern German]] legislators tipped the balance in favour of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government of reunited Germany. In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of Federal City ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesstadt}}). Bonn currently shares the status of Germany's seat of government with Berlin, with the [[President of Germany|President]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] and many government ministries (such as [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Food &amp; Agriculture]] and [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence]]) maintaining large presences in Bonn. Over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in Bonn.&lt;ref name="Cowell"/&gt; A total of 19 United Nations (UN) institutions operate from Bonn today.

==Politics==
[[File:Ashok Alexander Sridharan, Oberbürgermeister Bonn.jpg|thumb|Ashok Alexander Sridharan [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|(CDU)]] was the mayor of Bonn from 2015 until 2020.]]

=== City council ===
The [[city council]] of Bonn used to be based in the [[Rococo]]-style and 1737 built ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'' (old city hall) adjacent to Bonn's central market square. However, due to the enlargement of Bonn in 1969 through the incorporation of Beuel and Bad Godesberg, it moved into the larger Stadthaus facilities further up north. This was necessary for the city council to accommodate the increased number of representatives. The mayor of Bonn still sits in the ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'', which is also used for representative and official purposes.

As of the 2020–2025 election cycle, the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democrats (CDU)]] and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens (Bündnis'90/Die Grünen)]] hold 17 seats respectively, followed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats (SPD)]] with 11 seats, the local Bürgerbund Bonn with 5 seats, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Liberals (FDP)]] and Volt with 3 seats respectively, the [[The Left (Germany)|Left (Die Linke)]] with 4 seats, , the [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) with 2 seats, and independent candidates with a total of 4 seats. There are currently 66 seats in the city council of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rat. Ausschüsse.|url=https://www.bonn.de/service-bieten/stadtpolitik-ortsrecht/rat-ausschuesse.php|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Bundesstadt Bonn|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stadthaus-01-04-2013-133.jpg|thumb|The ''{{lang|de|Stadthaus}}'', home of the city council of Bonn.]]
The mayor is [[Katja Dörner]] (Bündnis '90/Die Grünen), elected in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://rp-online.de/nrw/kommunalwahl/ergebnis-stichwahl-bonn-2020-gruene-katja-doerner-wird-oberbuergermeisterin_aid-53552801 |title= Bonn wird grün - Katja Dörner gewinnt Stichwahl |last=Germany|first=RP Media|website=rp-online.de|access-date=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landtag election ===
Four delegates represent the Federal city of Bonn in the [[Landtag]] of [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The last election took place in May 2017. The current delegates are Guido Déus ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]), Christos Katzidis (CDU), Joachim Stamp [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|(FDP)]] and Franziska Müller-Rech (FDP).

=== German federal election ===
Bonn's [[Electoral district|constituency]] is called ''{{lang|de|Bundeswahlkreis Bonn}}'' (096). In the [[German federal election, 2017|German federal election 2017]], [[Ulrich Kelber]] [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|(SPD)]] was elected a member of [[Bundestag|German Federal parliament, the Bundestag]] by direct mandate. It is his fifth term. [[Katja Dörner]] representing Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and [[Alexander Graf Lambsdorff]] for [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] were eleceted as well. Kelber resigned in 2019 because he was appointed [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]]. As Dörner was elected Lord Mayer of Bonn in September 2020, she resigned as a member of parliament after her entry into office.

== Culture ==
Beethoven's birthplace is located in Bonngasse near the market place. Next to the market place is the Old City Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It is used for receptions of guests of the city, and as an office for the mayor. Nearby is the ''[[Electoral Palace, Bonn|Kurfürstliches Schloss]]'', built as a residence for the prince-elector and now the main building of the [[University of Bonn]]. 
[[File:Bonner Münster.jpg|thumb|Erected in the 11th and 13th century, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bonn Minster|Minster of Bonn]] is one of Germany's oldest churches.]]
The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'' is an avenue flanked by [[Chestnut]] trees which had the first [[horsecar]] of the city. It connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''[[Poppelsdorfer Schloss]]'', a palace that was built as a resort for the prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century, and whose grounds are now a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Bonn]]). This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], a building erected in 1883/84.

The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] stands on the Münsterplatz, which is flanked by the [[Bonn Minster]], one of Germany's oldest churches.

The three highest structures in the city are the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] in Bonn-Venusberg ({{convert|180|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' ({{convert|162.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' ({{convert|114.7|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) now the location of the UN Campus.

Just as Bonn's other four major museums, the ''[[Haus der Geschichte]]'' or Museum of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany, is located on the so-called ''Museumsmeile'' ("Museum Mile")''.'' The Haus der Geschichte is one of the foremost German museums of contemporary German history, with branches in [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]]. In its permanent exhibition, the Haus der Geschichte presents German history from 1945 until the present, also shedding light on Bonn's own role as former capital of West Germany. Numerous temporary exhibitions emphasize different features, such as Nazism or important personalities in German history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdg.de/index.php?id=1&amp;L=1|title=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Home|date=13 June 2008|publisher=Hdg.de|access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siebengebirge schloss drachenburg ds wv 09 2008.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Schloss Drachenburg|Drachenburg Castle]] in the [[Siebengebirge]] south of Bonn.]]
There are several parks, leisure and protected areas in and around Bonn. The ''{{ill|Rheinaue|de}}'' is Bonn's most important leisure park, with its role being comparable to what [[Central Park]] is for New York City. It lies on the banks of the Rhine and is the city's biggest park intra muros.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Freizeitpark Rheinaue]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhine promenade and the ''Alter Zoll'' (Old Toll Station) are in direct neighbourhood of the city centre and are popular amongst both residents and visitors. The ''[[Arboretum Park Härle]]'' is an [[arboretum]] with specimens dating to back to 1870. The ''[[Botanical Garden, Bonn|Botanischer Garten]]'' (Botanical Garden) is affiliated with the university and it is here where [[Titan arum]] set a world record.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Botanischer Garten Bonn]]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural reserve of ''[[Kottenforst]]'' is a large area of protected woods on the hills west of the city centre. It is about {{convert|40|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} in area and part of the [[Rhineland Nature Park]] ({{convert|1045|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Kottenforst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the very south of the city, on the border with [[Wachtberg]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], there is an extinct volcano, the [[Rodderberg]], featuring a popular area for hikes. Also south of the city, there is the [[Siebengebirge]] which is part of the lower half of the [[Middle Rhine]] region. The nearby upper half of the [[Middle Rhine]] from [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] to [[Koblenz]] is a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the [[Middle Ages]] and important German vineyards.

=== Air traffic ===
[[File:Koeln-Bonn-Airport11.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|The [[Cologne Bonn Airport|international airport of Cologne and Bonn]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]: CGN) is Germany's [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|seventh-largest]].]]
Named after [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first post-war Chancellor of West Germany, [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] is situated {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} north-east from the city centre of Bonn. With around 10.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers passing through it in 2015, it is the [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|seventh-largest passenger airport in Germany]] and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations. By traffic units, which combines cargo and passengers, the airport is in fifth position in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204205/http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, Cologne Bonn Airport had services to 115 passenger destinations in 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/sommerflugplan-2015-sieben-ziele-flughafen-koeln-bonn/35295|title=Sommerflugplan 2015: Sieben neue Ziele ab Flughafen Köln/Bonn|work=airliners.de|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is one of Germany's few 24-hour airports, and is a hub for [[Eurowings]] and cargo operators [[FedEx Express]] and [[UPS Airlines]].

The federal motorway (''Autobahn'') [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] connects the airport with the city. Long distance and regional trains to and from the airport stop at [[Cologne/Bonn Airport station]]. Other major airports within a one-hour drive by car are [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankurt International Airport]] and [[Düsseldorf Airport|Düsseldorf International Airport]].

=== Rail and bus system ===
[[File:2008-07-28 U-Bahnhof Hauptbahnhof (Bonn).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], Bonn's busiest railway station, is connected to Bonn's partly underground [[U-Bahn]] network.]]
Bonn's central railway station, [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], serves urban ([[S-train|S-Bahn]], [[U-Bahn]], sharing the same network with the neighbouring city of Cologne), regional ([[Regionalbahn]]), and long-distance destinations ([[Intercity-Express|ICE]]) such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Zurich, Vienna, Brussels, Amsterdam and Paris. Daily, more than 67,000 people travel via Bonn Hauptbahnhof. In late 2016, around 80 long distance and more than 165 regional trains departed to or from Bonn every day.&lt;ref name="general041116"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Sanierung-geht-in-die-heiße-Phase-article3397749.html|title=Sanierung geht in die heiße Phase|work=[[General-Anzeiger (Bonn)|General-Anzeiger]]|date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105205334/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Sanierung-geht-in-die-hei%C3%9Fe-Phase-article3397749.html|archive-date=5 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ga.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ga.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/der-hauptbahnhof-bonn-wird-saniert_aid-43091427|work=[[General-Anzeiger (Bonn)|General-Anzeiger]]|date=12 May 2017|title=Der Hauptbahnhof Bonn wird saniert|trans-title=Bonn Central Station is being renovated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201160203/https://ga.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/der-hauptbahnhof-bonn-wird-saniert_aid-43091427|archive-date=1 December 2020|language=de|author=Bettina Köhl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="db041116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/presse/duesseldorf/de/aktuell/presseinformationen/12647934/161107_schoene_aussichten.html|title=Schöne Aussichten im Hauptbahnhof Bonn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106105046/http://www.deutschebahn.com/presse/duesseldorf/de/aktuell/presseinformationen/12647934/161107_schoene_aussichten.html|archive-date=6 November 2016|website=Deutsche Bahn|date=4 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major railway station ([[Siegburg/Bonn station|Siegburg/Bonn]]) lies on the [[Köln–Frankfurt high-speed rail line|high-speed rail line between Cologne and Frankfurt]].

The bus system of Bonn is composed of roughly 30 lines which operate on a regular basis. During peaks, buses usually run every 5 minutes; off-peak buses run every 20 minutes. Several lines offer night services, especially during the weekends. Bonn is part of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg]] (''Rhine-Sieg Transport Association'') which is the public transport association covering the area of the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]].

=== Road network ===
[[File:Region Bonn motorways.png|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Road network adjacent to Bonn.]]
Four [[Autobahn]]s run through or are adjacent to Bonn: the [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] (right bank of the Rhine, connecting Bonn with [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]]), the [[Bundesautobahn 555|A555]] (left bank of the [[Rhine]], connecting Bonn with Cologne), the [[Bundesautobahn 562|A562]] (connecting the right with the left bank of the Rhine south of Bonn), and the [[Bundesautobahn 565|A565]] (connecting the A59 and the A555 with the [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] to the southwest). Three Bundesstraßen, which have a general {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=off}} [[speed limit]] in contrast to the Autobahn, connect Bonn to its immediate surroundings (Bundesstraßen B9, B42 and B56).

With Bonn being divided into two parts by the [[Rhine]], three bridges are crucial for inner-city road traffic: the Konrad-Adenauer-Brücke (A562), the Friedrich-Ebert-Brücke (A565), and the Kennedybrücke (B56). In addition, regular ferries operate between Bonn-Mehlem and [[Königswinter]], Bonn-Bad Godesberg and [[Niederdollendorf]], and Graurheindorf and Mondorf.

=== Port ===
Located in the northern sub-district of Graurheindorf, the [[Inland harbor|inland harbour]] of Bonn is used for container traffic as well as oversea transport. The annual turnover amounts to around {{convert|500000|t||abbr=on}}. Regular passenger transport occurs to Cologne and Düsseldorf.

==Sports==
Bonn is home of the [[Telekom Baskets Bonn]], the only basketball club in Germany that owns its arena, the [[Telekom Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telekom-baskets-bonn.de/telekom-dome/uebersicht.html "Telekom Baskets Bonn – Telekom Dome – Übersicht"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012040651/http://www.telekom-baskets-bonn.de/telekom-dome/uebersicht.html |date=12 October 2013 }}, ''Telekom-Baskets-Bonn.de''. Retrieved 8 March 2014. {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is a regular participant at international competitions such as the [[Basketball Champions League]].

The city also has a semi-professional football team [[Bonner SC]] which was formed in 1965 through the merger of ''Bonner FV'' and ''Tura Bonn''. The Bonn Gamecocks American football team play at the 12,000-capacity Stadion Pennenfeld.

The headquarters of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] has been located in Bonn since 1999.

==International relations==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Since 1983, the City of Bonn has established friendship relations with the City of [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, and since 1988 Bonn, in former times the residence of the Princes Electors of Cologne, and [[Potsdam]], Germany, the formerly most important residential city of the Prussian rulers, have established a city-to-city partnership.

Central Bonn is surrounded by a number of traditional towns and villages which were independent up to several decades ago. As many of those communities had already established their own contacts and partnerships before the regional and local reorganisation in 1969, the Federal City of Bonn now has a dense network of city district partnerships with European partner towns.

The city district of Bonn is a partner of the English university city of [[Oxford]], England, UK (since 1947), of [[Budafok]], District XXII of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (since 1991) and of [[Opole]], [[Poland]] (officially since 1997; contacts were established 1954).

The district of Bad Godesberg has established partnerships with [[Saint-Cloud]] in France, [[Frascati]] in Italy, [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|Windsor and Maidenhead]] in England, UK and [[Kortrijk]] in Belgium; a friendship agreement has been signed with the town of [[Yalova]], Turkey.

The district of Beuel on the right bank of the Rhine and the city district of Hardtberg foster partnerships with towns in France: [[Mirecourt]] and [[Villemomble]].

Moreover, the city of Bonn has developed a concept of international co-operation and maintains sustainability oriented project partnerships in addition to traditional city twinning, among others with [[Minsk]] in Belarus, [[Ulaanbaatar]] in Mongolia, [[Bukhara]] in Uzbekistan, [[Chengdu]] in China and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia.

Due to its location in the [[European Plain]], Berlin is influenced by a [[Temperate climate|temperate seasonal climate]]. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94LP4xCb-KcC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Gren Berlin|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|access-date=9 October 2009|isbn=9781740594721|last1=Schulte-Peevers|first1=Andrea|last2=Parkinson|first2=Tom|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city lies in the [[Central German]] dialect area, the [[Berlin dialect]] being a variant of the [[Lusatian-New Marchian dialects]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}
{{Further|Timeline of Berlin}}

===Etymology===
Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River [[Elbe]], that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) [[Saale]] (from their [[confluence]] at [[Barby, Germany|Barby]] onwards), the eastern border of the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]]. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''Bär'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting arm]].

Of Berlin's [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|twelve boroughs]], five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Pankow]] (the most populous), [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Treptow-Köpenick]] and [[Spandau]] (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[Lübars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schmöckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. The neighborhood of [[Moabit]] bears a [[French language|French]]-derived name, and [[Französisch Buchholz]] is named after the [[Huguenots]].

In 1415, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty |publisher=Antipas |year=1993 |access-date=18 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archive-date=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of [[Prussia]], and eventually as [[German emperor]]s. In 1443, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html |title=Berliner Unwillen |trans-title=Berlin unwillingness |publisher=Verein für die Geschichte Berlins e.&amp;nbsp;V. |first=Gerhild H.

After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector [[Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg|Albrecht III Achilles]], Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.&lt;ref name="Lui stadtgr"/&gt; Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg|John Cicero]] came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/en/history/the-electors-residence/ |title=The electors' residence |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co.

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.]]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]], crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Horlemann, Bernd (Hrsg.), Mende, Hans-Jürgen (Hrsg.): Berlin 1994. Taschenkalender. Edition Luisenstadt Berlin, Nr. 01280.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Königsberg]]. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".&lt;ref name="Stöver2010"/&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany.

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref name="HollandGawthrop2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Holland|author2=John Gawthrop|title=The Rough Guide to Berlin|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoberl00holl|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-682-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoberl00holl/page/361 361]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fields such as [[architecture]], [[painting]] and [[film|cinema]] new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{cvt|66|to|883|km2}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Nazis came to power|came to power]]. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450|title=The Jewish Community of Berlin|publisher=Holocuast Encyclopedia |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during {{Dash year|1943|1945}} Allied air raids and the 1945 [[Battle of Berlin]]. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built up area. Around 125,000 civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Clodfelter|first=Michael|title=Warfare and Armed Conflicts- A Statistical Reference to Casualty and Other Figures, 1500–2000|edition=2nd|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7864-1204-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39619/das-geteilte-berlin?p=all |title=Berlin – auf dem Weg zur geteilten Stadt |trans-title=Berlin – on the way to a divided city |date=27 April 2005 |first=Prof. Dr. Wolfgang |last=Benz |language=de |publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.]]

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic centre. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html |title=Berlin after 1945 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co. KG. |access-date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, East Germany began to build the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" speech in 1963, underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm |title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971 |publisher=U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany |year=1996 |access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall fell]] on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became a reunified city. [[Walter Momper]], the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and [[Eberhard Diepgen]] (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/world/berlin-mayoral-contest-has-many-uncertainties.html |title=Berlin Mayoral Contest Has Many Uncertainties |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a [[German reunification#Reunified Berlin|reunified Berlin]]&lt;ref name=ReUnificationParade&gt;{{cite news | last=Kinzer | first=Stephan | title=Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | location=New York City | date=19 June 1994 | access-date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994). On 20 June 1991, the [[Bundestag]] (German Parliament) [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Berlin}}

===Topography===
[[File:Berlin by Senitnel-2.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Berlin]]

Berlin is in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=Google Maps|access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at {{convert|122|m|abbr=off}} elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{cvt|120.1|m|disp=or}}), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |title=Berlin hat eine neue Spitze |trans-title=Berlin has a new top |first=Nikolaus |last=Triantafillou |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=de |publisher=Qiez |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|abbr=off}} elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|abbr=off}} elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |title=Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow |trans-title=The tallest mountain in Berlin is now in Pankow |date=22 February 2015 |access-date=22 February 2015 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |first=Stefan |last=Jacobs |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.]]

Berlin has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb'');&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=58301&amp;cityname=Berlin,+Germany|title=Berlin, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=30 January 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eastern part of the city has a slight continental influence (''Dfb''), especially in the 0&amp;nbsp;°C isotherm, one of the changes being the annual rainfall according to the [[air mass]]es and the greater abundance during a period of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bc-naklo.si/fileadmin/Vertikalne_ozelenitve_pdf/Ang_3_poglavje/3.1.3.pdf|title=The different types of vertical greening systems and their relative sustainability}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elkins2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VqRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |title=Berlin: The Spatial Structure of a Divided City|last1=Elkins|first1=Dorothy|last2=Elkins|first2=T.

Due to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many [[oceanic climate]]s. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[Humid continental climate|continental climate]] (''Dc'') under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha climate scheme]], as well as the suburbs of [[New York City|New York]], although the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] puts them in different types.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstengarbe FW, Werner PC (2009) A short update on Koeppen climate shifts in Europe between 1901 and 2003.

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{cvt|22|–|25|C}} and lows of {{cvt|12|–|14|C}}. Winters are cool with average high temperatures of {{cvt|3|C}} and lows of {{cvt|−2|to|0|C}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with [[Urban heat island|heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement]].

Berlin's history has left the city with a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]], fires and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West, were demolished during the post-war period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] on pre-war buildings was destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], and in both post-war systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' along with, the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the monumental buildings on [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|towers]] rise at various locations: [[Potsdamer Platz]], the [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

Over one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/gruenanlagen/de/daten_fakten/downloads/ausw_5.pdf|author=Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Verkehr und Klimaschutz Berlin, Referat Freiraumplanung und Stadtgrün|title=Anteil öffentlicher Grünflächen in Berlin|access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's second largest and most popular park, the [[Großer Tiergarten]], is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from [[Bahnhof Zoo]] in the City West to the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in the east.

The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{cvt|368|m}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html |title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable |work=The New York Times |access-date=18 August 2008 |first=Nicolai |last=Ouroussoff |date=9 May 2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{cvt|55|m}} and an observation deck {{cvt|126|m}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,&lt;ref name="pop-detail"/&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dmitry Bulgakov |url=http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |title=Berlin is speaking Russians' language |publisher=Russiajournal.com |date=11 March 2001 |access-date=10 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406142034/http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |archive-date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article616463/Berlin_wird_farbiger_Die_Afrikaner_kommen.html |title=Berlin wird farbiger.

===Languages===
{{Main|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
[[German language|German]] is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |access-date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects]]. It is spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Brandenburgisch dialect|Brandenburgish]] variant. The dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |title=Studie – Zwei Millionen Berliner sprechen mindestens zwei Sprachen – Wirtschaft – Berliner Morgenpost – Berlin |publisher=Morgenpost.de |date=18 May 2010 |access-date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zensus 2011 – Bevölkerung und Haushalte – Bundesland Berlin|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|website=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|pages=6–7|access-date=23 February 2019|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193809/https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest religious denomination recorded in 2010 was the [[Protestant]] [[Landeskirche|regional church body]]—the [[Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia|Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)]]—a [[United church]]. EKBO is a member of the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD)]] and [[Union Evangelischer Kirchen|Union Evangelischer Kirchen (UEK)]]. According to the EKBO, their membership accounted for 18.7 percent of the local population, while the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] had 9.1 percent of residents registered as its members.&lt;ref name="kirchenmitglieder2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2010.pdf |title=Kirchenmitgliederzahlen am 31.12.2010 |trans-title=Church membership on 31 December 2010 |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Evangelical Church in Germany]] |access-date=10 March 2012 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209204513/https://www.ekd.de/ekd_de/ds_doc/Ber_Kirchenmitglieder_2010.pdf |archive-date=9 February 2018 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2.7% of the population identify with other Christian denominations (mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], but also various Protestants).&lt;ref name="klStatistik2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Produkte/kleinestatistik/kBEst_2010.pdf |title=Die kleine Berlin–Statistik 2010 |trans-title=The small Berlin statistic 2010 |publisher=[[List of statistical offices in Germany|Amt für Statistik Berlin–Brandenburg]] |date=December 2010 |access-date=4 January 2011 |language=de |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085946/https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/Produkte/kleinestatistik/kBEst_2010.pdf |archive-date=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Berlin residents register, in 2018 14.9 percent were members of the Evangelical Church, and 8.5 percent were members of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="pop-detail"/&gt; The government keeps a register of members of these churches for tax purposes, because it collects [[Church tax#Germany|church tax]] on behalf of the churches.

[[File:Rotes_Rathaus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rotes Rathaus]] (''Red City Hall''), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin]]
Since [[German reunification|reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]] among the present 16 states of Germany. The [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats.

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough has a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.&lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |access-date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin's official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities/&gt;

Public transportation in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since [[1989]], the transport network has been developed extensively; however, it still contains early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century traits, such as the U1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolf, Winfried.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33163088|title=Berlin, Weltstadt ohne Auto? : Verkehrsgeschichte 1848-2015|date=1994|publisher=ISP|isbn=3-929008-74-2|edition=1.

Berlin is served by one commercial international airport: [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing [[Berlin Tegel Airport|{{lang|de|Tegel|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|{{lang|de|Schönefeld|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.&lt;ref name="BBC 2018-11-06"&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Schultheis|date=6 November 2018|access-date=23 May 2019|title=Whatever happened to Berlin's deserted 'ghost' airport?|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berlin's new $7 billion airport has finally opened after 9 years of delays, corruption allegations, and construction woes— see inside |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/berlin-brandenburg-airport-finally-opens-after-9-years-of-delays-2020-11?r=US&amp;IR=T |website=Business Insider |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=9 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned initial capacity of around 27&amp;nbsp;million passengers per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=23 May 2019 |title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg BER |url=https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/1872865-2932875-airport-berlin-brandenburg-ber.en.html |website=berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55&amp;nbsp;million per year by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=23 May 2019 |title=BER: A brief history of how not to build an airport |url=https://www.tip-berlin.de/ber-a-brief-history-of-how-not-to-build-an-airport/ |date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5&amp;nbsp;million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |title=2014 summer flight schedule |website=FBB |access-date=10 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911063838/http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |archive-date=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|de|Tegel|italic=no}} Airport was a focus city for [[Lufthansa]] and [[Eurowings]] while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like {{lang|de|[[Germania (airline)|Germania]]|italic=no}}, [[easyJet]] and [[Ryanair]]. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller [[Tempelhof Airport]], which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city centre allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport.

====Cycling====
{{Main|Cycling in Berlin}}

Berlin is well known for its highly developed bicycle lane system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/07/bike_city_berli.php |title=Bike City Berlin |website=Treehugger |access-date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13% of total traffic in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/193840.platz-da-8211-fuer-die-radfahrer.html |title=Platz da! – für die Radfahrer |website=Neues Deutschland |access-date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclists have access to {{cvt|620|km|0}} of bicycle paths including approximately {{cvt|150|km|0}} of mandatory bicycle paths, {{cvt|190|km|0}} of off-road bicycle routes, {{cvt|60|km|0}} of bicycle lanes on roads, {{cvt|70|km|0}} of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, {{cvt|100|km|0}} of combined pedestrian/bike paths and {{cvt|50|km|0}} of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/politik_planung/zahlen_fakten/download/Mobility_en_komplett.pdf |title=Berlin Traffic in Figures |website=Senate Department of Urban Development |year=2013 |access-date=14 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319085713/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/politik_planung/zahlen_fakten/download/Mobility_en_komplett.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riders are allowed to carry their bicycles on {{lang|de|[[Regionalbahn]]|italic=no}}, S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, on trams, and on night buses if a bike ticket is purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/mobil/fahrrad/bus_bahn/ |title=Mit dem Fahrrad – In Bussen und Bahnen |trans-title=By Bicycle – In Buses and Trains |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |language=de |access-date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rohrpost (pneumatic postal network)====
{{Main|Rohrpost in Berlin}}
From 1865 until 1976 Berlin had an extensive [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic postal network]], which at its peak in 1940, totalled 400 kilometres length. After 1949 the system was split in two separated networks. The West Berlin system in operation and open for public use until 1963, and for government use until 1972. The East Berlin system which inherited the ''Hauptelegraphenamt'', the central hub of the system, was in operation until 1976

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant]]

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and the Berlin-based company [[GASAG]]. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [[Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|title=European Green City Index Berlin Germany|website=Siemens|year=2009|access-date=19 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913113150/https://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}} the five [[List of power stations in Germany|largest power plants measured by capacity]] are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [[power station]]s generate [[electricity generation|electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

The [[Charité]] complex (Universitätsklinik Charité) is the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including [[Emil von Behring]], Robert Koch and [[Paul Ehrlich]], have worked at the Charité. The Charité is spread over four campuses and comprises around 3,000 beds, 15,500 staff, 8,000 students, and more than 60 operating theaters, and it has a turnover of two billion euros annually.&lt;ref name=charite_facts&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.charite.de/en/the_charite/about_us/facts_figures/ |title=Facts &amp; Figures|author=Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin |language=en |access-date=27 June 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charité]] is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers.

Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. The scientific research at these institutions is complemented by many research departments of companies such as Siemens and Bayer. The [[World Health Summit]] and several international health related conventions are held annually in Berlin.

Since 2017, the [[digital television]] standard in Berlin and Germany is [[DVB-T2]]. This system transmits [[video compression|compressed]] [[digital audio]], [[digital video]] and other data in an [[MPEG transport stream]].

Berlin has installed several hundred free public [[Wireless LAN]] sites across the capital since 2016. The wireless networks are concentrated mostly in central districts; 650 hotspots (325 indoor and 325 outdoor access points) are installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/berlin-to-get-free-public-wi-fi-in-early-2016--1115805|title=Berlin to get free public Wi-Fi in early 2016|website=telecompaper|date=26 November 2015|access-date=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsche Bahn is planning to introduce Wi-Fi services in long distance and regional trains in 2017.{{update inline|date=January 2021}}

The [[UMTS]] (3G) and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] (4G) networks of the three major cellular operators [[Vodafone]], [[T-Mobile]] and [[Telefónica Germany|O2]] enable the use of mobile broadband applications citywide.

The [[Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications|Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute]] develops mobile and stationary [[broadband]] communication networks and multimedia systems. Focal points are [[Photonics|photonic components and systems]], [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] sensor systems, and [[Digital image processing|image signal processing]] and [[Signal processing|transmission]].

Berlin has three major [[opera house]]s: the [[Deutsche Oper]], the [[Berlin State Opera]], and the [[Komische Oper]]. The Berlin State Opera on [[Unter den Linden]] opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its musical director is [[Daniel Barenboim]]. The Komische Oper has traditionally specialized in [[operetta]]s and is also at Unter den Linden. The Deutsche Oper opened in 1912 in Charlottenburg.

The city's main venue for musical theater performances are the Theater am Potsdamer Platz and [[Theater des Westens]] (built in 1895). Contemporary dance can be seen at the ''Radialsystem V''. The [[Tempodrom]] is host to concerts and circus inspired entertainment. It also houses a multi-sensory spa experience. The [[Admiralspalast]] in Mitte has a vibrant program of [[variety show|variety]] and music events.

The [[German cuisine|cuisine]] and culinary offerings of Berlin vary greatly. Twelve restaurants in Berlin have been included in the [[Michelin Guide]] of 2015, which ranks the city at the top for the number of restaurants having this distinction in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/fashion/09iht-luxmag18.html |title=Berlin Minimalist Glamor |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin is well known for its offerings of [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveur.com/vegetarian-restaurants-berlin-germany |title=Good Taste Award Winner 2015: Berlin, The New Vegetarian Capital|publisher=SAVEUR |access-date=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Veganism|vegan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/berlin-vegan-capital-of-the-world/a-35951064 |title=Berlin: Vegan capital of the world?|publisher=DW |access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; cuisine and is home to an innovative entrepreneurial food scene promoting cosmopolitan flavors, local and sustainable ingredients, pop-up street food markets, supper clubs, as well as food festivals, such as Berlin Food Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/berlins-booming-food-scene/a-17983026 |title=Berlin's booming food scene|publisher=DW |access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foodtank.com/news/2016/09/conscious-food-consumption-at-berlins-restlos-gluecklich/ |title=Conscious Food Consumption at Berlin's Restlos Glücklich|publisher=Food Tank |access-date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local foods originated from north German culinary traditions and include rustic and hearty dishes with pork, goose, fish, peas, beans, cucumbers, or potatoes. Typical Berliner fare include popular [[street food]] like the ''[[Currywurst]]'' (which gained popularity with post-war construction workers rebuilding the city), ''[[Frikadeller|Buletten]]'' and the ''[[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]]'' doughnut, known in Berlin as {{lang|de|Pfannkuchen}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/berlin.cfm Berlin] German Foods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spicy-sausage-that-is-worthy-of-a-shrine-in-berlin-1772530.html|title=Spicy sausage that is worthy of a shrine in Berlin|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Tony|last=Paterson|date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; German bakeries offering a variety of breads and pastries are widespread.

Berlin is also home to a diverse gastronomy scene reflecting the immigrant history of the city. Turkish and Arab immigrants brought their culinary traditions to the city, such as the [[lahmajoun]] and [[falafel]], which have become common fast food staples. The modern fast food version of the [[doner kebab]] sandwich which [[Kadir Nurman|evolved in Berlin]] in the 1970s, has since become a favorite dish in Germany and elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432704577350194262835880| title=There's Nothing More German Than a Big, Fat Juicy Döner Kebab| author=James Angelos| date=18 April 2012| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian cuisine like Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Korean, and Japanese restaurants, as well as Spanish tapas bars, Italian, and Greek cuisine, can be found in many parts of the city.

'''Bromine''' is a [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Br''' and [[atomic number]] 35. It is the third-lightest [[halogen]], and is a fuming red-brown [[liquid]] at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. Isolated independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]] (in 1825) and [[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Jérôme Balard]] (in 1826), its name was derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] βρῶμος ("stench"), referring to its sharp and disagreeable smell.

Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur [[free element|free]] in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide [[Ionic salt|salts]], analogous to [[table salt]]. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br{{sup|−}}) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from [[brine pool]]s, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.

At [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] it is a liquid; the only other element that is liquid under these conditions is [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. At high temperatures, [[organobromine compound]]s readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops [[free radical]] chemical [[chain reaction]]s. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as [[fire retardant]]s, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet [[sunlight]] to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the [[atmosphere]] to yield free bromine atoms, causing [[ozone depletion]]. As a result, many organobromide compounds—such as the [[pesticide]] [[Bromomethane|methyl bromide]]—are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in [[well drilling fluids]], in [[photographic film]], and as an intermediate in the manufacture of [[organic compound|organic]] chemicals.

Large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ion, causing [[bromism]]. However, a clear biological role for bromide ion and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated, and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans. The role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer. As a [[pharmaceutical]], the simple bromide ion (Br{{sup|−}}) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as [[antiepileptic]]s.

==History==
[[File:Antoine Jérôme Balard 1870s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Balard]], one of the discoverers of bromine]]
Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]]&lt;ref name=L1/&gt; and [[Antoine Jérôme Balard|Antoine Balard]],&lt;ref name="Bal1826"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balard"/&gt; in 1825 and 1826, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The discovery of the elements: XVII. The halogen family|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|author-link=Mary Elvira Weeks|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|date = 1932|volume = 9|page = 1915|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|bibcode=1932JChEd...9.1915W|issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown [[Bad Kreuznach]] in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with [[diethyl ether]]. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.&lt;ref name="Löwig" /&gt;

Balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of [[seaweed]] from the [[salt marsh]]es of [[Montpellier]]. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried to prove that the substance was [[iodine monochloride]] (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''muria'' for brine.&lt;ref name="Balard" /&gt;

After the French chemists [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the [[Académie des Sciences]] and published in ''Annales de Chimie et Physique''.&lt;ref name="Bal1826" /&gt; In his publication, Balard stated that he changed the name from ''muride'' to ''brôme'' on the proposal of M. Anglada. ''Brôme'' (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench).&lt;ref name="Bal1826" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bal1826b"/&gt; Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] suggested the name ''brôme'' for the characteristic smell of the vapors.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wisniak"/&gt; Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in [[Stassfurt]] enabled its production as a by-product of potash.&lt;ref name=Greenwood790&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 790&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Some also suggest that it may have been discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]], the man who discovered iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apart from some minor medical applications, the first commercial use was the [[daguerreotype]]. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive [[silver halide]] layer in daguerreotypy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Daguerreotype: Nineteenth-century Technology and Modern Science|first = M.

[[Potassium bromide]] and [[sodium bromide]] were used as [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[sedative]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by [[chloral hydrate]] and then by the [[barbiturate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac|first = Edward|last = Shorter| publisher = John Wiley and Sons|date = 1997|isbn = 978-0-471-24531-5|page =200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[First World War]], bromine compounds such as [[xylyl bromide]] were used as [[poison gas]].&lt;ref name="Borden_chemwarfare"&gt;{{cite book | title = Medical Aspects of Chemical Warfare | year = 2008 | publisher = [[Borden Institute]] | authors = Corey J Hilmas, Jeffery K Smart, Benjamin A Hill | chapter = Chapter 2: History of Chemical Warfare (pdf) | pages = 12–14 | chapter-url = http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/chemwarfare/CHAP2_Pg_09-76.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromine is the third [[halogen]], being a [[nonmetal]] in group 17 of the periodic table. Its properties are thus similar to those of [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[iodine]], and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration [Ar]3d{{sup|10}}4s{{sup|2}}4p{{sup|5}}, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its [[valence electron]]s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to [[periodic trend]]s, it is intermediate in [[electronegativity]] between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the [[bromide]] ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]], whose work foreshadowed the [[periodic law]] for chemical elements.&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;{{cite web | title = Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner| publisher = Purdue University| url = http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114215946/http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2014-11-14| access-date = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Historic Overview: Mendeleev and the Periodic Table | publisher = NASA| url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/UnderElem/UnderElem_pdf/HistOverST.pdf | access-date = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intermediate in [[atomic radius]] between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first [[ionisation energy]], [[electron affinity]], enthalpy of dissociation of the X{{sub|2}} molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.&lt;ref name=Greenwood793&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 793–4&lt;/ref&gt;

All four stable halogens experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s of attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 58.8&amp;nbsp;°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''π{{sub|g}}'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''σ{{sub|u}}'' molecular orbital.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–9&lt;/ref&gt; The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195&amp;nbsp;°C is pale yellow.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

Like solid chlorine and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the [[orthorhombic crystal system]], in a layered lattice of Br{{sub|2}} molecules. The Br–Br distance is 227&amp;nbsp;pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228&amp;nbsp;pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331&amp;nbsp;pm within a layer and 399&amp;nbsp;pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195&amp;nbsp;pm). This structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{sup|−13}}&amp;nbsp;Ω{{sup|−1}}&amp;nbsp;cm{{sup|−1}} just below the melting point, although this is better than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

At a pressure of 55&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75&amp;nbsp;GPa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure. At 100&amp;nbsp;GPa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Duan, Defang|title = Ab initio studies of solid bromine under high pressure|journal = Physical Review B|volume = 76|date = 2007-09-26|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.104113|page = 104113|bibcode = 2007PhRvB..76j4113D|issue = 10 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of bromine}}
Bromine has two stable [[isotope]]s, {{sup|79}}Br and {{sup|81}}Br. These are its only two natural isotopes, with {{sup|79}}Br making up 51% of natural bromine and {{sup|81}}Br making up the remaining 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus may be used for [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], although {{sup|81}}Br is more favourable. The relatively 1:1 distribution of the two isotopes in nature is helpful in identification of bromine containing compounds using mass spectroscopy. Other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with [[half-life|half-lives]] too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are {{sup|80}}Br (''t''{{sub|1/2}} = 17.7&amp;nbsp;min), {{sup|80m}}Br (''t''{{sub|1/2}} = 4.421&amp;nbsp;h), and {{sup|82}}Br (''t''{{sub|1/2}} = 35.28&amp;nbsp;h), which may be produced from the [[neutron activation]] of natural bromine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The most stable bromine radioisotope is {{sup|77}}Br (''t''{{sub|1/2}} = 57.04&amp;nbsp;h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than {{sup|79}}Br is [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[selenium]]; that of isotopes heavier than {{sup|81}}Br is [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[krypton]]; and {{sup|80}}Br may decay by either mode to stable {{sup|80}}Se or {{sup|80}}Kr.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{NUBASE 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromine is intermediate in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, and is one of the most reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the [[standard electrode potential]]s of the X{{sub|2}}/X{{sup|−}} couples (F, +2.866&amp;nbsp;V; Cl, +1.395&amp;nbsp;V; Br, +1.087&amp;nbsp;V; I, +0.615&amp;nbsp;V; At, approximately +0.3&amp;nbsp;V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt;

===Hydrogen bromide===
The simplest compound of bromine is [[hydrogen bromide]], HBr. It is mainly used in the production of inorganic [[bromide]]s and [[alkyl bromide]]s, and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry. Industrially, it is mainly produced by the reaction of [[hydrogen]] gas with bromine gas at 200–400&amp;nbsp;°C with a [[platinum]] catalyst. However, reduction of bromine with [[red phosphorus]] is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory:&lt;ref name=Greenwood809&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809–12&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 P + 6 H{{sub|2}}O + 3 Br{{sub|2}} → 6 HBr + 2 H{{sub|3}}PO{{sub|3}}
: H{{sub|3}}PO{{sub|3}} + H{{sub|2}}O + Br{{sub|2}} → 2 HBr + H{{sub|3}}PO{{sub|4}}

At room temperature, hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.&lt;ref name=Greenwood809/&gt; Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as [[hydrobromic acid]], which is a strong acid (p''K''{{sub|a}} = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H{{sub|2}}O system also involves many hydrates HBr·''n''H{{sub|2}}O for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine [[anion]]s and [[hydronium]] [[cation]]s. Hydrobromic acid forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 124.3&amp;nbsp;°C at 47.63&amp;nbsp;g HBr per 100&amp;nbsp;g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H{{sub|2}}Br{{sup|+}} and {{chem|HBr|2|-}} ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs{{sup|+}}]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu{{sup|''n''}}]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812/&gt;

===Other binary bromides===
[[File:Bromid stříbrný.PNG|thumb|right|[[Silver bromide]] (AgBr)]]
Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es, with the exception of [[xenon]] in the very unstable XeBr{{sub|2}}); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[fluorine]], and [[chlorine]]), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, nitrides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen tribromide]] is named as a bromide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood821&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromination of metals with Br{{sub|2}} tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with Cl{{sub|2}} when a variety of oxidation states is available. Bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrobromic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, [[carbon tetrabromide]], or an organic bromide. For example, [[niobium(V) oxide]] reacts with carbon tetrabromide at 370&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[niobium(V) bromide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt; Another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess "halogenating reagent", for example:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;
:FeCl{{sub|3}} + BBr{{sub|3}} (excess) → FeBr{{sub|3}} + BCl{{sub|3}}
When a lower bromide is wanted, either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent, or thermal decomposition or [[disproportionation]] may be used, as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;
: 3 WBr{{sub|5}} + Al {{overunderset|→|thermal gradient|475°C → 240°C}} 3 WBr{{sub|4}} + AlBr{{sub|3}}
: EuBr{{sub|3}} + {{sfrac|1|2}} H{{sub|2}} → EuBr{{sub|2}} + HBr
: 2 TaBr{{sub|4}} {{overunderset|→|500°C|&amp;nbsp;}} TaBr{{sub|3}} + TaBr{{sub|5}}

Most of the bromides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. [[Silver bromide]] is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

===Bromine halides===
The halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY{{sub|3}}, XY{{sub|5}}, and XY{{sub|7}} (where X is heavier than Y), and bromine is no exception. Bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride, as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride. Some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as {{chem|BrF|2|-}}, {{chem|BrCl|2|-}}, {{chem|BrF|2|+}}, {{chem|BrF|4|+}}, and {{chem|BrF|6|+}}. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen bromide]] (BrCN), bromine [[thiocyanate]] (BrSCN), and bromine [[azide]] (BrN{{sub|3}}).&lt;ref name=Greenwood824&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The pale-brown [[bromine monofluoride]] (BrF) is unstable at room temperature, disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct reaction of the elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures.&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt; [[Bromine monochloride]] (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though it can be made by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in [[carbon tetrachloride]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt; Bromine monofluoride in [[ethanol]] readily leads to the monobromination of the [[aromaticity|aromatic]] compounds PhX (''para''-bromination occurs for X = Me, Bu{{sup|''t''}}, OMe, Br; ''meta''-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –CO{{sub|2}}Et, –CHO, –NO{{sub|2}}); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br{{sup|+}}.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

At room temperature, [[bromine trifluoride]] (BrF{{sub|3}}) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than [[chlorine trifluoride]]. It reacts vigorously with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[silicon]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], iodine, and [[sulfur]] to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, it is used to oxidise [[uranium]] to [[uranium hexafluoride]] in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF{{sub|4}} and BrF{{sub|2}}SbF{{sub|6}} remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form {{chem|BrF|2|+}} and {{chem|BrF|4|-}} and thus conducts electricity.&lt;ref name=Greenwood828&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bromine pentafluoride]] (BrF{{sub|5}}) was first synthesised in 1930. It is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150&amp;nbsp;°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of [[potassium bromide]] at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood832&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polybromine compounds===
Although dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, very strong oxidisers such as [[peroxydisulfuryl fluoride]] (S{{sub|2}}O{{sub|6}}F{{sub|2}}) can oxidise it to form the cherry-red {{chem|Br|2|+}} cation. A few other bromine cations are known, namely the brown {{chem|Br|3|+}} and dark brown {{chem|Br|5|+}}.&lt;ref name=Greenwood842&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842–4&lt;/ref&gt; The tribromide anion, {{chem|Br|3|-}}, has also been characterised; it is analogous to [[triiodide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;

[[Bromine oxide]]s are not as well-characterised as [[chlorine oxide]]s or [[iodine oxide]]s, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought that they could not exist at all. [[Dibromine monoxide]] is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60&amp;nbsp;°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5&amp;nbsp;°C; it is useful in [[bromination]] reactions&lt;ref name="handin"&gt;

It oxidises iodine to [[iodine pentoxide]] and [[benzene]] to [[1,4-benzoquinone]]; in alkaline solutions, it gives the [[hypobromite]] anion.&lt;ref name=Greenwood850&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 850–1&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called "[[bromine dioxide]]", a pale yellow crystalline solid, may be better formulated as bromine [[perbromate]], BrOBrO{{sub|3}}. It is thermally unstable above −40&amp;nbsp;°C, violently decomposing to its elements at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Dibromine trioxide]], ''syn''-BrOBrO{{sub|2}}, is also known; it is the anhydride of [[hypobromous acid]] and [[bromic acid]]. It is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above −40&amp;nbsp;°C; if heated too rapidly, it explodes around 0&amp;nbsp;°C. A few other unstable radical oxides are also known, as are some poorly characterised oxides, such as [[dibromine pentoxide]], tribromine octoxide, and bromine trioxide.&lt;ref name=Greenwood850/&gt;

The four [[oxoacid]]s, [[hypobromous acid]] (HOBr), [[bromous acid]] (HOBrO), [[bromic acid]] (HOBrO{{sub|2}}), and [[perbromic acid]] (HOBrO{{sub|3}}), are better studied due to their greater stability, though they are only so in aqueous solution. When bromine dissolves in aqueous solution, the following reactions occur:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromous acids and [[bromite]]s are very unstable, although the [[strontium]] and [[barium]] bromites are known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood862&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 862–5&lt;/ref&gt; More important are the [[bromate]]s, which are prepared on a small scale by oxidation of bromide by aqueous [[hypochlorite]], and are strong oxidising agents. Unlike chlorates, which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perchlorate, the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions. Bromic acid is a strong acid. Bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood862/&gt;
:{{chem|BrO|3|-}} + 5 Br{{sup|−}} + 6 H{{sup|+}} → 3 Br{{sub|2}} + 3 H{{sub|2}}O

There were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid, leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist, until 1968 when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive [[beta decay]] of unstable {{chem|83|Se|O|4|2-}}. Today, perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas. Excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as [[silver bromate]] and [[calcium fluoride]], and the perbromic acid solution may be purified. The perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising, with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it, such as fluorine or [[xenon difluoride]]. The Br–O bond in {{chem|BrO|4|-}} is fairly weak, which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements [[arsenic]], [[selenium]], and bromine to attain their group oxidation state, as they come after the [[scandide contraction]] characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood871&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 871–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organobromine compounds===
{{main|Organobromine compound}}
[[File:N-Bromosuccinimide.svg|thumb|upright|Structure of [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]], a common brominating reagent in organic chemistry]]
Like the other carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine (2.96) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Br bond is electron-deficient and thus [[electrophilic]]. The reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of [[organochlorine compound|organochlorine]] and [[organoiodine compound]]s. For many applications, organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost.&lt;ref name=KO/&gt;

Organobromides are typically produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors. Bromine itself can be used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used, such as [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]]. The principal reactions for organobromides include [[dehydrohalogenation|dehydrobromination]], [[Grignard reaction]]s, [[Wurtz reaction|reductive coupling]], and [[nucleophilic substitution]].&lt;ref name=KO&gt;Ioffe, David and Kampf, Arieh (2002) "Bromine, Organic Compounds" in ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI| 10.1002/0471238961.0218151325150606.a01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organobromides are the most common organohalides in nature, even though the concentration of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br{{sup|+}}, a potent electrophile. The enzyme [[bromoperoxidase]] catalyzes this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja047925p|pmid=15548002|title=Vanadium Bromoperoxidase-Catalyzed Biosynthesis of Halogenated Marine Natural Products|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=126|issue=46|pages=15060–6|year=2004|last1=Carter-Franklin|first1=Jayme N.|last2=Butler|first2=Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of [[bromoform]] and 56,000 tons of [[bromomethane]] annually.&lt;ref name="Gribble99" /&gt;

[[Image:Alkene-bromine-addition-2D-skeletal.png|upright=1.8|thumb|Bromine addition to alkene reaction mechanism]]
An old qualitative test for the presence of the [[alkene]] functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a [[halohydrin|bromohydrin]] with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic [[halonium ion|bromonium]] intermediate. This is an example of a [[halogen addition reaction]].&lt;ref name=Clayden&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Clayden | first1 = Jonathan | author-link1 = Jonathan Clayden | last2 = Greeves | first2 = Nick | last3 = Warren | first3 = Stuart | author-link3 = Stuart Warren | title = Organic Chemistry | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-19-927029-3 |pages=427–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:STS028-96-65.jpg|thumb|View of salt evaporation pans on the Dead Sea, where Jordan (right) and Israel (left) produce salt and bromine]]
Bromine is significantly less abundant in the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It is significantly more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]]. There, it makes up 65&amp;nbsp;parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the [[Dead Sea]] contains 0.4% bromide ions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 795–6&lt;/ref&gt; It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.&lt;ref name=o1&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Minerals From Sea Salt|first = John A.|last = Tallmadge|author2 = Butt, John B.|author3 = Solomon Herman J.|journal = Ind.

The main sources of bromine are in the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using chlorine gas to oxidise Br{{sup|−}} to Br{{sub|2}}. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of the chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 798–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in [[Industry (manufacturing)|industry]]. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from [[hydrogen bromide]], which is obtained by burning [[hydrogen]] in bromine.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mills, Jack F. |title=Bromine: in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag|location= Weinheim|date= 2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a04_391|chapter=Bromine|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flame retardants===
[[File:Tetrabromobisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|Tetrabromobisphenol A]]

[[Brominated flame retardant]]s represent a commodity of growing importance, and make up the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces [[hydrobromic acid]] which interferes in the radical [[chain reaction]] of the [[oxidation]] reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 14|pages = 426–442| date = 1996|doi = 10.1177/073490419601400602|title = Mechanisms for Flame Retardancy and Smoke suppression – A Review|first =Joseph|last = Green|issue = 6 |s2cid = 95145090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume = 77|date = 2002|pages = 325–331| doi = 10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8|title = Fire retardant mechanism of aliphatic bromine compounds in polystyrene and polypropylene|first = Jelle|last = Kaspersma|author2 = Doumena, Cindy|author3 = Munrob Sheilaand|author4 = Prinsa, Anne-Marie|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during [[polymerisation]]. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, [[vinyl bromide]] can be used in the production of [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] or [[polypropylene]]. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, [[tetrabromobisphenol A]] can be added to [[polyester]]s or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxies used in [[printed circuit board]]s are normally made from such flame retardant [[resin]]s, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products ([[FR-4]] and [[FR-2]]). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, [[decabromodiphenyl ether]] can be added to the final polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 22|pages = 25–40| date = 2004|doi = 10.1177/0734904104038107|title = A Review of Current Flame Retardant Systems for Epoxy Resins|first = Edward D.|last = Weil|author2=Levchik, Sergei|s2cid = 95746728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated [[halomethane]] compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include [[bromochloromethane]] (Halon 1011, CH{{sub|2}}BrCl), [[bromochlorodifluoromethane]] (Halon 1211, CBrClF{{sub|2}}), and [[bromotrifluoromethane]] (Halon 1301, CBrF{{sub|3}}).&lt;ref name=UllmannF&gt;Günter Siegemund, Werner Schwertfeger, Andrew Feiring, Bruce Smart, Fred Behr, Herward Vogel, Blaine McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Silver bromide]] is used, either alone or in combination with [[silver chloride]] and [[silver iodide]], as the light sensitive constituent of [[photographic emulsion]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt;

[[1,2-Dibromoethane|Ethylene bromide]] was an [[Gasoline additive|additive in gasolines]] containing lead anti-[[engine knocking]] agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Environment International|volume = 29|date = 2003| doi = 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1|title = An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release|first = Mehran|last = Alaeea|author2 = Ariasb, Pedro|author3 = Sjödinc, Andreas|author4 = Bergman, Åke|issue = 6|pmid=12850087|pages = 683–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poisonous [[bromomethane]] was widely used as [[pesticide]] to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used.&lt;ref name="USGSYB2007" /&gt; These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as [[ozone depletion]] agents. The [[Montreal Protocol|Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]] scheduled the phase out for the [[ozone depleting]] chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they have been replaced by such compounds as [[sulfuryl fluoride]], which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control [[nematode]]s, [[fungi]], [[weed]]s and other soil-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alternatives to Methyl Bromide for the Control of Soil-Borne Diseases and Pests in California|first = Belinda|last = Messenger|author2 = Braun, Adolf|date = 2000|publisher = Pest Management Analysis and Planning Program|url = http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf|access-date = 2008-11-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100421041145/http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf#|archive-date = 2010-04-21|url-status = dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economics of the "Critical Use" of Methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol|doi = 10.1093/cep/byi028|journal =Contemporary Economic Policy|volume = 23|pages = 376–393|date = 2008|first = Stephen J.|last = Decanio|author2=Norman, Catherine S.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''pharmacology''', inorganic [[bromide]] compounds, especially [[potassium bromide]], were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like [[Bromo-Seltzer]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hopkins Adams|title=The Great American fraud|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanfr03adamgoog|access-date=2011-06-25 |date=1905|publisher=Press of the American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available organobromine pharmaceuticals include the vasodilator [[nicergoline]], the sedative [[brotizolam]], the anticancer agent [[pipobroman]], and the antiseptic [[merbromin]]. Otherwise, organobromine compounds are rarely pharmaceutically useful, in contrast to the situation for [[organofluorine chemistry|organofluorine compounds]]. Several drugs are produced as the bromide (or equivalents, hydrobromide) salts, but in such cases bromide serves as an innocuous counterion of no biological significance.&lt;ref name=KO/&gt;

Other uses of organobromine compounds include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as [[Tyrian purple]] and the indicator [[bromothymol blue]]), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, as well as some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. [[silver bromide]] for photography).&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt; [[Zinc–bromine battery|Zinc–bromine batteries]] are hybrid [[Flow battery|flow batteries]] used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.

A 2014 study suggests that bromine (in the form of bromide ion) is a necessary cofactor in the biosynthesis of [[collagen IV]], making the element [[essential element|essential]] to [[basement membrane]] architecture and tissue development in animals.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal| display-authors = 5| author = McCall AS| author2 = Cummings CF| author3 = Bhave G| author4 = Vanacore R| author5 = Page-McCaw A| author6 = Hudson BG|title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|date = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009| pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no clear deprivation symptoms or syndromes have been documented.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Forrest H.|chapter=Possibly Essential Trace Elements|year=2000|pages=[https://archive.org/details/clinicalnutritio0000unse_l0q5/page/11 11–36]|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/clinicalnutritio0000unse_l0q5/page/11|doi=10.1007/978-1-59259-040-7_2|journal=Clinical Nutrition of the Essential Trace Elements and Minerals|isbn=978-1-61737-090-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other biological functions, bromine may be non-essential but still beneficial when it takes the place of chlorine.

Eosinophil peroxidase is a [[haloperoxidase]] that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating [[hypobromite]] ([[hypobromous acid]]), although the use of chloride is possible.&lt;ref name="pmid2538427"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Mayeno AN| author2 = Curran AJ| author3 = Roberts RL| author4 = Foote CS|title = Eosinophils preferentially use bromide to generate halogenating agents|journal = J.

The bromide anion is not very toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;milligrams.&lt;ref name=Nielsen2000/&gt; However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the membrane of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as [[bromism]]. Bromide has an [[elimination half-life]] of 9 to 12 days, which can lead to excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1&amp;nbsp;gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare.&lt;ref name=pdo2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Kent R. |title=Poisoning &amp; drug overdose |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuec3nTovyUC |edition=4th |date=1 November 2003 |publisher=Appleton &amp; Lange |isbn=978-0-8385-8172-8 |pages=140–141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in [[somnolence]], [[psychosis]], [[seizures]] and [[delirium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental bromine is toxic and causes [[chemical burns]] on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure may lead to frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds.&lt;ref name=msds&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927659 |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Bromine MSDS |author=Science Lab.com |website=sciencelab.com |access-date=27 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115230355/http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927659 |archive-date=15 November 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt; The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) of the [[United States]] has set a [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1&amp;nbsp;ppm.

'''Heidelberg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|d|əl|b|ɜːr|ɡ}} {{respell|HY|dəl|burg}}, {{IPA-de|ˈhaɪdl̩bɛʁk|lang|Heidelberg.ogg}}) is a [[college town|university town]] in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], situated on the river [[Neckar]] in south-west [[Germany]]. In the 2016 census, its population was 159,914, of which roughly a quarter consisted of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/universitaet/statistik/studierende.html|title=Daten und Fakten – Studierende und Wissenschaftlicher Nachwuchs – Universität Heidelberg|last=Albers|first=Jürgen|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located about {{convert|78|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Frankfurt]], Heidelberg is the fifth-largest city in Baden-Württemberg. Heidelberg is part of the densely populated [[Rhine-Neckar|Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region]].

[[Heidelberg University]], founded in 1386, is Germany's oldest and one of Europe's most reputable universities.&lt;ref&gt;Its latest overall ranking positions range from 5th to 18th in Europe; the peer review scores, reflecting academic esteem, are usually higher. It was never ranked outside Europe's top 20 by any major university ranking. See [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg#Academic profile|rankings]].&lt;/ref&gt; Heidelberg is a [[Science|scientific hub]] in Germany and home to several internationally renowned [[#Research|research facilities]] adjacent to its university, including the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] and four [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Institutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/institutions/non_university.html|title=Non-University Research Institutions – Heidelberg University|last=Stiefel|first=Catherine|website=www.uni-heidelberg.de|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also been a hub for the arts, especially literature, throughout the centuries, and it was designated a "[[City of Literature]]" by the [[UNESCO]] [[Creative Cities Network]].

Heidelberg was a seat of government of the former [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] and is a popular [[tourism|tourist destination]] due to its [[Romanticism|romantic]] cityscape, including [[Heidelberg Castle]], the [[#Philosophers' Walk|Philosophers' Walk]], and the [[Baroque]] old town.

==Geography==
[[File:Heidelberg Stadtteile 2012.svg|thumb|right|The districts of Heidelberg]]
Heidelberg is in the [[Rhine Rift Valley]], on the left bank of the lower part of the Neckar in a steep valley in the [[Odenwald]]. It is bordered by the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königsstuhl]] (568&amp;nbsp;m) and the [[Gaisberg (Heidelberg)|Gaisberg]] (375&amp;nbsp;m) mountains. The Neckar here flows in an east–west direction. On the right bank of the river, the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] mountain rises to a height of 445 meters. The Neckar flows into the [[Rhine]] approximately 22 kilometres north-west in [[Mannheim]]. Villages incorporated during the 20th century stretch from the Neckar Valley along the Bergstraße, a road running along the [[Odenwald]] hills.

Heidelberg is on [[European walking route E1]] ([[Sweden]]-[[Umbria]]).
[[File:Heidelberg from the Königstuhl.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg seen from [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]]]]

===Flora and fauna===
Since Heidelberg is among the warmest regions of Germany, plants atypical of the [[Central Europe|central-European]] climate flourish there, including [[almond]] and [[Common fig|fig trees]]; there is also an [[olive tree]] in ''Gaisbergstraße''. Alongside the ''Philosophenweg'' (Philosophers' Walk) on the opposite side of the Old Town, [[winegrowing]] was restarted in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hilfe-hd.de/rohrbach/wein.htm |title=Heidelberg-Rohrbach: Wein, Reben und Winzer |publisher=Hilfe-hd.de |access-date=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a wild population of African [[rose-ringed parakeet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Stefanie Wegener: ''Verbreitung und Arealnutzung der Halsbandsittiche (Psittacula krameri) in Heidelberg'', published by: Ornithologische Gesellschaft Baden-Württemberg e.&amp;nbsp;V., [http://www.ogbw.de/doc/Abstract_WegenerSittiche.pdf Ornithol. Jh. Bad.-Württ. 23: 39–55 (2007)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719070417/http://www.ogbw.de/doc/Abstract_WegenerSittiche.pdf |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a wild population of [[Siberia]]n [[swan goose|swan geese]], which can be seen mainly on the islands in the [[Neckar]] near the district of Bergheim.

===Administrative structures===
[[File:Altstadt Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|left|The Old Town]]

Heidelberg is a [[Unitary authority#Germany|unitary authority]] within the [[Karlsruhe (region)|Regierungsbezirk Karlsruhe]]. The [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]] rural district surrounds it and has its seat in the town, although the town is not a part of the district. Heidelberg is a part of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region, often referred to as the [[Rhein-Neckar-Triangle|Rhein-Neckar Triangle]].

This region consists of the southern part of the [[States of Germany|State]] of [[Hessen]], the southern part of the State of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] (''Vorderpfalz''), the administrative districts of [[Mannheim]] and Heidelberg, and the municipalities of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]. The Rhein-Neckar Triangle became a European [[metropolitan area]] in 2005.

Heidelberg consists of 15 districts distributed in six sectors of the town. In the central area are Altstadt (the Old Town), [[Heidelberg-Bergheim|Bergheim]] and Weststadt; in the north, Neuenheim and Handschuhsheim; in the east, [[Heidelberg-Ziegelhausen|Ziegelhausen]] and Schlierbach; in the south, [[Heidelberg-Südstadt|Südstadt]], Rohrbach, Emmertsgrund, and Boxberg; in the southwest, [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]; in the west, Pfaffengrund, Wieblingen, and a new district, named ''Bahnstadt'', is built on land in Weststadt and Wieblingen. The new district will have approximately 5,000–6,000 residents and employment for 7,000. Further new residential space for 10,000-15,000 residents was made available in Patrick Henry Village following the departure of the US Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heidelberg.de/Konversion,Lde/Startseite+Konversion.html|title=Konversion Heidelberg - Startseite Konversion|website=www.heidelberg.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neighbouring communes===
The following towns and [[commune]]s border the city of Heidelberg, beginning in the west and in a clockwise direction: [[Edingen-Neckarhausen]], [[Dossenheim]], [[Schriesheim]], [[Wilhelmsfeld]], [[Schönau (Odenwald)|Schönau]], [[Neckargemünd]], [[Bammental]], [[Gaiberg]], [[Leimen (Baden)|Leimen]], [[Sandhausen]], [[Oftersheim]], [[Plankstadt]], [[Eppelheim]] (all part of the [[Rhein-Neckar-Kreis]]) and [[Mannheim]].

===Climate===
Heidelberg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), defined by the protected valley between the Pfälzerwald and the Odenwald. Year-round, the mild temperatures are determined by maritime air masses coming from the west. In contrast to the nearby [[Upper Rhine Plain]], Heidelberg's position in the valley leads to more frequent easterly winds than average. The hillsides of the Odenwald favour clouding and precipitation. The warmest month is July, the coldest is January. Temperatures often rise beyond {{convert|30|°C|0}} in [[midsummer]]. According to the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst|German Meteorological Service]], Heidelberg was the warmest place in Germany in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Mechthild Henneke: ''Wetterextreme in Deutschland 2009''. In: ''[[Südkurier]]'', 28. April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Kreisbeschreibung Bd. 1'', S. 54ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Deutschland/heidelberg2.html|title=Das Klima in Heidelberg|website=www.klimadiagramme.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Heidelberg nachts.jpg|thumb|Heidelberg on the Neckar at night]]
[[File:Heidelberg Hauptstraße 207.jpg|thumb|Karlsplatz and Neckar with Old Bridge]]

===Early history===
Between 600,000 and 200,000 years ago{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, "[[Homo heidelbergensis|Heidelberg Man]]" died at nearby [[Mauer (Baden)|Mauer]]. His jaw bone was discovered in 1907. Scientific dating determined his remains as the earliest evidence of human life in Europe. In the 5th century BC, a [[Celts|Celtic]] fortress of refuge and place of worship were built on the ''Heiligenberg'', or "Holy Mountain". Both places can still be identified. In 40 AD, a fort was built and occupied by the 24th Roman cohort and the 2nd [[Cyrenaican]] cohort (CCG XXIIII and CCH II CYR). The early Byzantine/late Roman Emperor Valentinian I, in 369 AD, built new and maintained older ''[[castra]]'' (permanent camps) and a signal tower on the bank of the [[Neckar]]. They built a wooden bridge based on stone pillars across it. The camp protected the first civilian settlements that developed. The Romans remained until 260 AD, when the camp was conquered by [[Germanic people|Germanic tribes]]. The local administrative center in Roman times was the nearby city of [[Lopodunum]], today known as [[Ladenburg]].

[[File:Carl Blechen 003.jpg|thumb|[[Heidelberg Castle]], here shown in a painting by [[Carl Blechen]], was destroyed by the French during the war of succession of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]]][[File:Heidelberg - panoramio (39).jpg|thumb|View of castle from the Corn Market]] 
Modern Heidelberg can trace its beginnings to the fifth century. The village ''Bergheim'' ("Mountain Home") is first mentioned for that period in documents dated to 769 AD. ''Bergheim'' now lies in the middle of modern Heidelberg. The people gradually converted to Christianity. In 863 AD, the [[monastery]] of [[St. Michael]] was founded on the [[Heiligenberg (Heidelberg)|Heiligenberg]] inside the double rampart of the Celtic fortress. Around 1130, the Neuburg Monastery was founded in the Neckar valley. At the same time, the bishopric of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] extended its influence into the valley, founding [[Schönau Abbey]] in 1142. Modern Heidelberg can trace its roots to this 12th-century monastery. The first reference to Heidelberg can be found in a document in [[Schönau Abbey]] dated to 1196. This is considered to be the town's founding date. In 1155, Heidelberg castle and its neighboring settlement were taken over by the house of [[Hohenstaufen]]. [[Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] became [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Pfalzgraf bei Rhein}}). In 1195, the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] passed to the [[House of Welf]] through marriage. In 1214, [[Louis I, Duke of Bavaria|Ludwig I, Duke of Bavaria]] acquired the Palatinate, as a consequence of which the castle came under his control. By 1303, another castle had been constructed for defense. In 1356, the Counts Palatine were granted far-reaching rights in the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], in addition to becoming [[Prince-elector|Electors]]. In 1386, [[Heidelberg University]] was founded by [[Rupert I, Elector Palatine]].

===Modern history===
Heidelberg University played a leading part in the era of humanism and the Reformation, and the conflict between Lutheranism and Calvinism, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Heidelberg's library, founded in 1421, is the oldest existing public library in Germany. In April 1518, a few months after proclaiming his ''[[Ninety-five Theses]]'', [[Martin Luther]] was received in Heidelberg, to defend them. In 1537, the castle located higher up the mountain was destroyed by a gunpowder explosion. The duke's palace was built at the site of the lower castle. [[File:Belagerung Heidelbergs C-L 205.jpg|thumb|The siege of Heidelberg 1622]]
[[Elector Frederick III]], sovereign of the [[Electoral Palatinate]] from 1559 to 1576, commissioned the composition of a new Catechism for his territory. While the catechism's introduction credits the "entire theological faculty here" (at the [[University of Heidelberg]]) and "all the superintendents and prominent servants of the church" for the composition of the catechism, Zacharius Ursinus is commonly regarded as the catechism's principal author. [[Caspar Olevianus]] (1536–1587) was formerly asserted as a co-author of the document, though this theory has been largely discarded by modern scholarship. [[Johann Sylvan]], [[Adam Neuser]], Johannes Willing, [[Thomas Erastus]], Michael Diller, Johannes Brunner, Tilemann Mumius, Petrus Macheropoeus, Johannes Eisenmenger, [[Immanuel Tremellius]] and [[Pierre Boquin]] are all likely to have contributed to the Catechism in some way. Frederick himself wrote the preface to the Catechism and closely oversaw its composition and publication. Frederick, who was officially Lutheran but had strong Reformed leanings, wanted to even out the religious situation of his highly Lutheran territory within the primarily Catholic [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[Council of Trent]] had just concluded with its conclusions and decrees against the Protestant faiths, and the [[Peace of Augsburg]] had only granted toleration for [[Lutheranism]] within the empire where the ruler was Lutheran. One of the aims of the catechism was to counteract the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as Anabaptists and "strict" [[Gnesio-Lutherans]] like [[Tilemann Heshusius]] and [[Matthias Flacius]], who were resisting Frederick's Reformed influences, particularly on the matter of Eucharist ([[the Lord's Supper]]). The Catechism-based each of its statements on biblical proof-texts, and Frederick himself would defend it as biblical, not reformed, at the 1566 Diet of Augsburg when he was called to answer to charges of violating the Peace of Augsburg. This was the [[Heidelberg Catechism]], officially called the ″Catechism, or Christian Instruction, according to the Usages of the Churches and Schools of the Electoral Palatinate.″

In November 1619, the royal crown of Bohemia was offered to the Elector, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]]. (He was married to [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]], eldest daughter of [[James VI and I]] of Scotland and England, respectively.) Frederick became known as the "Winter King", as he reigned for only one winter before the Imperial [[House of Habsburg]] regained the crown by force. His overthrow in 1621 marked the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. In 1622, after a [[Siege of Heidelberg (1622)|siege of two months]], the armies of the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]], commanded by [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], captured the town. Tilly gave the famous ''[[Bibliotheca Palatina]]'' from the [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] to the Pope as a present. The Catholic Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach gained control over the Palatinate and the title of Prince-Elector.

In late 1634, after the Swedish army had conquered Heidelberg, imperial forces attempted to take back the city. They quickly took the city, but were unable to take the castle. As they prepared to blow up its fortifications with gunpowder the French army arrived, 30,000 men strong, led by [[Urbain de Maillé-Brézé]], who had fought in many battles and participated in the [[Siege of La Rochelle]] (1627–1628), and [[Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duc de La Force]]. They ended the siege and drove off the Catholic forces.&lt;ref&gt;Helfferich, Tryntje, The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History (Cambridge, 2009), pp. 289–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648, at the end of the war, Frederick V's son [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], was able to recover his titles and lands. To strengthen his dynasty, Charles I Louis arranged the marriage of his daughter [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Liselotte]] to [[Philip I, Duke of Orléans]], brother of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], king of France. In 1685, after the death of Charles Louis' son, Elector [[Charles II, Elector Palatine|Charles II]], Louis XIV laid claim to his sister-in-law's inheritance. The Germans rejected the claim, in part because of religious differences between local Protestants and the French Catholics, as the [[Protestant Reformation]] had divided the peoples of Europe. The [[War of the Grand Alliance]] ensued. In 1689, French troops took the town and castle, bringing nearly total destruction to the area in 1693. As a result of the destruction due to repeated French invasions related to the [[War of the Palatinate Succession]] coupled with severe winters, thousands of Protestant German Palatines emigrated from the lower Palatinate in the early 18th century. They fled to other European cities and especially to London (where the refugees were called "the poor Palatines"). In sympathy for the Protestants, in 1709–1710, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne's]] government arranged transport for nearly 6,000 Palatines to New York. Others were transported to [[Pennsylvania]], and to [[South Carolina]]. They worked their passage and later settled in the English colonies there.

In 1720, after assigning a major church for exclusively Catholic use, religious conflicts with the mostly Protestant inhabitants of Heidelberg caused the Roman Catholic Prince-Elector [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] to transfer his residence to nearby [[Mannheim]]. The court remained there until the Elector [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria|Charles Theodore]] became [[Rulers of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] in 1777 and established his court in [[Munich]]. In 1742 Elector Charles Theodore began rebuilding the Palace. In 1764, a lightning bolt destroyed other palace buildings during reconstruction, causing the work to be discontinued.

===1803 to 1933===
Heidelberg fell to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]] in 1803. [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden]], re-founded the university, named "Ruperto-Carola" after its two founders. Notable scholars soon earned it a reputation as a "royal residence of the intellect". In the 18th century, the town was rebuilt in the Baroque style on the old medieval layout.

In 1810 the [[French revolution]] refugee Count Charles Graimberg began to preserve the palace [[ruins]] and establish a historical collection. In 1815, the Emperor of [[Austria]], the Emperor of [[Russia]] and the King of [[Prussia]] formed the "[[Holy Alliance]]" in Heidelberg. In 1848, the German National Assembly was held there. In 1849, during the Palatinate-Baden rebellion of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 Revolutions]], Heidelberg was the headquarters of a revolutionary army. It was defeated by a Prussian army near Waghaeusel. The city was occupied by Prussian troops until 1850. Between 1920 and 1933, Heidelberg University became a center of notable physicians Czerny, Erb, and Krehl; and humanists Rohde, Weber, and Gandolf.

===Nazism and the World War II-period===
During the Nazi period (1933–1945), Heidelberg was a stronghold of the [[NSDAP]]/Nazi party, (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) the strongest party in the elections before 1933 (the NSDAP obtained 30% at the communal elections of 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=209–10}})&lt;/ref&gt;). The NSDAP received 45.9% of the votes in the [[German federal election, March 1933|German federal election of March 1933]] (the national average was 43.9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cser|2007|p=229}})&lt;/ref&gt; Non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] university staff were discriminated against. By 1939, one-third of the university's teaching staff had been forced out for racial and political reasons. The non-Aryan professors were ejected in 1933, within one month of Hitler's rise to power. The lists of those to be deported were prepared beforehand.{{vague|date=October 2010}}{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 1934 and 1935 the ''Reichsarbeitsdienst'' (State Labor Service) and Heidelberg University students built the huge [[Heidelberg Thingstätte|''Thingstätte'' amphitheatre]] on the ''Heiligenberg'' north of the town, for [[Nazi Party]] and [[SS]] events. A few months later, the inauguration of the huge Ehrenfriedhof memorial cemetery completed the second and last NSDAP project in Heidelberg. This cemetery is on the southern side of the old part of town, a little south of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] hilltop, and faces west towards France. During World War II and after, [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers were buried there.
[[File:Heidelberger Synagogenplatz 2.JPG|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the synagogue in the Lauerstrasse]]
During the ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on November 9, 1938, Nazis burned down synagogues at two locations in the city. The next day, they started the systematic deportation of Jews, sending 150 to [[Dachau concentration camp]]. On October 22, 1940, during the "Wagner Buerckel event", the Nazis deported 6000 local Jews, including 281 from Heidelberg, to [[Camp Gurs]] concentration camp in France. Within a few months, as many as 1000 of them (201 from Heidelberg) died of hunger and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cser|2007|pp=246–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the deportees from Heidelberg, the poet [[Alfred Mombert]] (1872–1942) left the [[nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] in April 1941 thanks to the Swiss poet Hans Reinhart but died shortly thereafter due to illness he contracted while held prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599|title=Alfred Mombert|work=Badische Landesbibliothek|language=de|archive-date=September 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919171757/https://www.blb-karlsruhe.de/sammlungen/alte-drucke-und-rara/bestand/nachlassbibliotheken/#c599}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1942, the deportees who had survived internment in Gurs were deported to Eastern Europe, where most of them were murdered.

On March 29, 1945, German troops left the city after destroying three arches of the old bridge, Heidelberg's treasured river crossing. They also destroyed the more modern bridge downstream. The U.S. Army ([[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd Infantry]], 7th Army) entered the town on March 30, 1945. The civilian population surrendered without resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Kleine Heidelberger Stadtgeschichte |last=Fink |first=Oliver |year=2005 |isbn=978-3-7917-1971-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidelberg, unlike many other cities in Germany, was not targeted by Allied bombing raids during the war. A popular belief is that Heidelberg escaped bombing in World War II because the U.S. Army wanted to use the city as a garrison after the war, but, as Heidelberg was neither an industrial center nor a transport hub, it did not present a tactical or strategic target. Other notable university towns, such as [[Tübingen]] and [[Göttingen]], were spared bombing as well. Allied air raids focused extensively on the nearby industrial cities of [[Mannheim]] and [[Ludwigshafen]].

The U.S. Army may have chosen Heidelberg as a garrison base because of its excellent infrastructure, including the Heidelberg-Mannheim [[Autobahn]] (motorway), which connected to the Mannheim-Darmstadt-Frankfurt Autobahn, and the U.S. Army installations in [[Mannheim]] and [[Frankfurt]]. The intact rail infrastructure was more important in the late 1940s and early 1950s when most heavy loads were still carried by train, not by truck. Heidelberg had the untouched Wehrmacht barracks, the "Grossdeutschland Kaserne" which the US Army occupied soon after, renaming it the [[Campbell Barracks]].

===History after 1945===
In 1945 the university was reopened relatively quickly on the initiative of a small group of professors, among whom were the anti-Nazi economist [[Alfred Weber]] and the philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Remy|2002|page=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgeon Karl Heinrich Bauer was nominated rector.

On December 9, 1945, US Army General [[George S. Patton]] had a car accident in the adjacent city of [[Mannheim]] and died in the Heidelberg US Army hospital on December 21, 1945. The funeral ceremony was held at the Heidelberg-Weststadt ''Christuskirche'' (Christ Church), and he was buried in the 3rd Army cemetery in [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George S. Patton#Accident and death]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the post-war [[military occupation]], the [[U.S. Army]] used the ''[[Heidelberg Thingstätte|Thingstätte]]'' for cultural and religious events. Civilian use started in the early to mid-1980s for occasional concerts and other cultural events. Today, the celebrations on ''Hexennacht'' ("Witches' Night"), also called [[Walpurgis Night]]), the night of April 30, are a regular "underground" fixture at the ''Thingstätte''. Thousands of mostly young people congregate there to drum, to breathe fire, and to juggle. The event has gained fame throughout the region, as well as a certain notoriety due to the amount of litter left behind.

==Population==
[[File:Heidelberg population.svg|thumb|Population growth]]
The population of the city of Heidelberg exceeded 100,000 for the first time in 1946. It is a city with an international population, including one of the largest American communities outside North America, but this is not analysed in the Heidelberg population statistics. At the end of December 2011, the city had 149,633 inhabitants with an official primary residence in Heidelberg (not including the soldiers and employees of the U.S. Army and their dependents, a total of about 20,000 people), a historic high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |publisher=Statistical office of the state of Baden-Württemberg |title=Population of city of Heidelberg |access-date=25 July 2012 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207050411/http://www.statistik.baden-wuerttemberg.de/SRDB/Tabelle.asp?01035050GE221000 |archive-date=December 7, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows the number of inhabitants within the boundaries of the city at the time. To 1833 they are mostly estimates, then census results or official updates of the statistical offices of the time or the city administration. The data refer from 1843 to the "local population", from 1925 to the resident population and since 1987 the "population at the site of their main dwelling." Prior to 1843 the population was determined by non-uniform collection procedures.

Since 2006, the ''Oberbürgermeister'' (lord mayor) of Heidelberg has been the independent Eckart Würzner. From 1990 to 2006, the mayor was Beate Weber (SPD).

The council consists of 48 volunteer members with the mayor as chairman. The council is directly elected for a term of five years. The task of the council is to decide all the affairs of the city, with the mayor presiding. The council controls the city administration and oversees the enforcement of its decisions.

Heidelberg has always been a stronghold of the Greens. For the municipal elections in 2009, they split into the Green Alternative List and Alliance 90/The Greens and each ran their own lists. Together they gained 10 seats to become the strongest force for the first time.

In September 2011, two members of the GAL Group joined the Alliance 90/The Greens, so that together with the members of {{Not a typo|generation.hd}}, they formed the largest group in the council.

[[File:Heidelberg winter.jpg|thumb|right|View from the castle during winter, 2014]]

The "old town" ({{lang-de|link=no|Altstadt}}), on the south bank of the Neckar, is long and narrow. It is dominated by the ruins of [[Heidelberg Castle]], 80 metres above the Neckar on the steep wooded slopes of the [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]] (''King's chair or throne'') hill.
*The Main Street (''Hauptstrasse''), a mile-long pedestrian street, running the length of the old town.
*The [[Old Bridge (Heidelberg)|old stone bridge]] was erected 1786–1788. A medieval bridge gate is on the side of the old town, and was originally part of the town wall. Baroque tower helmets were added as part of the erection of the stone bridge in 1788.
*The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] (''Heiliggeistkirche''), a [[Gothic architecture|late Gothic]] church in the marketplace of the old town.
*The Karls‘ gate (''Karlstor'') is a triumphal arch in honour of the Prince Elector Karl Theodor, located at Heidelberg's east side. It was built 1775–1781 and designed by Nicolas de Pigage.
*The house ''Zum Ritter Sankt Georg'' (Knight St. George) is one of the few buildings to survive the War of Succession. Standing across from the Church of the Holy Spirit, it was built in the style of the late [[Renaissance]]. It is named after the sculpture at the top.
*The ''Marstall'' (Stables), a 16th-century building on the Neckar that has served several purposes through its history. It is now a cafeteria for the university.

===Heidelberg Castle===
{{Main|Heidelberg Castle}}
[[File:Plan des Heidelberger Schlosses von Peter Friedrich von Walpergen um 1780.jpg|thumb|Historic map of [[Heidelberg Castle]]]]
[[File:Heidelberg 17.11.2012 - panoramio (10).jpg|thumb|Heidelberg Castle at night]]
[[File:Heidelberg Schloss Luftbild 2.JPG|thumb|right|Heidelberg Fortress]]
[[File:Michaelskloster von Westen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]]]]

The castle is a mix of styles from [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] to [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Prince Elector Ruprecht III (1398–1410) erected the first building in the inner courtyard as a royal residence. The building was divided into a ground floor made of stone and framework upper levels. Another royal building is located opposite the Ruprecht Building: the Fountain Hall. Prince Elector Philipp (1476–1508) is said to have arranged the transfer of the hall's columns from a decayed palace of [[Charlemagne]] from [[Ingelheim]] to Heidelberg.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Prince Electors added two palace buildings and turned the fortress into a castle. The two dominant buildings at the eastern and northern side of the courtyard were erected during the rule of Ottheinrich (1556–1559) and Friedrich IV (1583–1610). Under Friedrich V (1613–1619), the main building of the west side was erected, the so-called "English Building".

The castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the Palatine War of Succession. As Prince Elector Karl Theodor tried to restore the castle, lightning struck in 1764, and ended all attempts at rebuilding. Later on, the castle was misused as a quarry; stones from the castle were taken to build new houses in Heidelberg. This was stopped in 1800 by Count Charles de Graimberg, who then began the process of preserving the castle.

Although the interior is in Gothic style, the King's Hall was not built until 1934. Today, the hall is used for festivities, e.g. dinner banquets, balls and theatre performances. During the Heidelberg Castle Festival in the summer, the courtyard is the site of open air musicals, operas, theatre performances, and classical concerts performed by the Heidelberg Philharmonics.

The castle is surrounded by a park, where the famous poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] once walked. The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] [[funicular]] railway runs from Kornmakt to the summit of the Königstuhl via the castle.

The castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schloss-heidelberg.de/en/home/|title=Schloss Heidelberg: Staatliche Schlösser und Gärten Baden-Württemberg|website=www.schloss-heidelberg.de|language=en|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophers' Walk===
On the northern side of the Neckar is located the Heiligenberg (''Saints' Mountain''), along the side of which runs the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), with scenic views of the old town and castle. Traditionally, Heidelberg's philosophers and university professors would walk and talk along the pathway. Farther up the mountain lie the ruined 11th-century [[Monastery of St. Michael (Heidelberg)|Monastery of St. Michael]], the smaller Monastery of St. Stephen, a Nazi-era amphitheater, the so-called Pagan's hole and the remains of an earthen [[Celts|Celtic]] [[hill fort]] from the 4th century BC.

===Heidelberg churches===
[[File:Heidelberg,_Alte_Br%C3%BCcke,_Heiliggeistkirche_20170601_004.jpg|[[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] tower and old bridge monument|thumb]]

There are many historical churches in Heidelberg and its surroundings. The [[Church of the Holy Spirit, Heidelberg|Church of the Holy Spirit]] has been shared over the centuries since the [[Protestant Reformation]] by both Catholics and Protestants. It is one of the few buildings to survive the many wars during the past centuries. It was rebuilt after the French set fire to it in 1709 during the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of the Palatinian Succession]]. The church has remains of the tombs and epitaphs of the past Palatinate electors. This Church stands in the ''Marktplatz'' next to the seat of local government. In 1720, Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine came into conflict with the town's Protestants as a result of giving the Church of the Holy Spirit exclusively to the Catholics for their use. It had previously been split by a partition and used by both congregations. Due to pressure by the mostly Protestant powers of Prussia, Holland, and Sweden, Prince Karl III Philip gave way and repartitioned the church for joint use. In 1936 the separating wall was removed. The church is now exclusively used by Protestants. Furthermore, there is the Catholic Church of the Jesuits. Its construction began in 1712. It was completed with the addition of a bell tower from 1866 to 1872. The church is also home to the Museum für sakrale Kunst und Liturgie (Museum of [[Ecclesiastical]] Arts). The oldest church in Heidelberg is the St. Peter's Church (now [[Lutheran]]). It was built some time during the 12th century.

==Education==
===Universities and academia===
{{Main|Heidelberg University|List of Heidelberg University people}}

[[File:Heidelberg Universitätsbibliothek 2003.jpg|thumb|The university library]]

Heidelberg is known for its institutions of higher education. The most famous of those is [[Heidelberg University]] Founded in 1386, it is one of Europe's oldest institutions. In fact, Heidelberg is the oldest [[college town|university town]] of today's Germany. Among the prominent thinkers associated with the institution are [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Jaspers]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Karl-Otto Apel]] and [[Hannah Arendt]]. The campus is situated in two urban areas and several buildings. In numerous historical buildings in the old town there are the Faculties of the [[Humanities]], the [[Social Science]] and the Faculty of [[Jurisprudence|Law]]. The school of applied sciences is located in the ''Science Tower'' in Wieblingen. The Faculties of Medicine and [[Natural Science]] are settled on the Neuenheimer Feld Campus.

The campus of Heidelberg University has a total undergraduate enrollment of 30,898 as of 2014. The enrollment rate of this university is 16.3 percent. Less than 20 percent of the total student body is international. This university has many areas of study for national students such as; theology, law, philosophy, modern languages, economics, and social sciences. The university does not charge students for tuition. The school's academic calendar is semester based, and the majority of the language for instruction is in German. For international students the academic calendar is based on a block schedule. The international students attend in block periods of 5 weeks. The University or "Uni" is spread across three campuses each containing different fields of study.
[[File:Heidlbergaula.JPG|thumb|left|Old university hall]]
Since 1904 there has been a College of Educational Science, the ''Pädagogische Hochschule Heidelberg''; since 1979 there has been a college of Jewish Studies, the ''[[Hochschule für Jüdische Studien Heidelberg]]''. It comprises nine branches specializing in both religion and [[Judaism|Jewish culture]]. The [[Schiller International University]], a private American university is also represented with a campus in Heidelberg offering several undergraduate and graduate programs in the fields of International Business and International Relations and Diplomacy.

===Research===
[[File:EMBL campus Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Buildings of [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg, including the new Advanced Training Centre]]

In addition to the research centers and institutes of the university, there are numerous research institutions situated in the city of Heidelberg. Among them are the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL), [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[German Cancer Research Center]] (DKFZ), [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research]], [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]], [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]], [[Max Planck Institute for Comparative Public Law and International Law]].

===Schools===
[[File:Fachhochschule Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|left|SRH Hochschule Heidelberg is one of the oldest and largest private universities in Germany]]

Heidelberg is home to 23 elementary schools. There are several institutions of secondary education, both public and private, representing all levels of the [[German school system]]. There are 14 [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]]s, with six of them private. With 52% of secondary students attending a Gymnasium, Heidelberg sits above the German average, perhaps because a large number of academics live in Heidelberg and its environs.

The gymnasiums include the {{ill|Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium|de|Kurfürst-Friedrich-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, {{ill|Bunsen-Gymnasium|de|Bunsen-Gymnasium Heidelberg}}, [[Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg|Helmholtz-Gymnasium]], Hölderlin-Gymnasium and Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule. Then there are seven [[Realschule]], ten [[Hauptschule]] and nine [[vocational school]]s (the so-called ''[[Berufsschule]]''). In addition, there are several [[folk high schools]] with different specialisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044135/http://www.heidelberg.de/servlet/PB/menu/1012912/index.html|date=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heidelberg International School]] serves the local expatriate community.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
In 2004, 81.8% of people worked for service industries, including tourism. As a relic of the period of Romanticism, Heidelberg has been labeled a "Romantic town". This is used to attract more than [https://www.heidelberg.de/english/Home/Life/Heidelberg+in+figures.html#:~:text=11.9%20million%20visitors.,11.9%20million%20visitors%20every%20year. 11.9 million visitors] every year. Many events are organized to attract visitors. One of the biggest tourist attractions is the Christmas market during the winter time.

===Industry===
Only 18% of employment is provided by industry. Printing and publishing are important enterprises; nearby [[Walldorf]] is a center of the IT industry and [[SAP SE|SAP]] World Headquarters. Noted pen manufacturer [[Lamy]] has its headquarters and factory in Heidelberg-Wieblingen. [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen]] has its headquarters here; its factory is located in Walldorf. Soft-drink company Wild-Werke, manufacturer of the [[Capri-Sonne]] ([[Capri-Sun]] in the U.S.) is located nearby in Eppelheim. Heidelberg is also home to the headquarters of [[HeidelbergCement]], the world's second largest cement producer. The company has its roots in the suburb of Leimen where one of its cement plants is still located. With its long Hauptstrasse, Heidelberg is a shopping destination for people from the surrounding smaller towns.
[[File:Heidelberger Druckmaschinen.jpg|thumb|right|Print Media Academy]]

===Roads===
The [[Bundesautobahn 5|A 5 autobahn]] runs through the western outskirts of Heidelberg, connecting the region to [[Frankfurt am Main]] in the north and [[Karlsruhe]] to the south. The [[Bundesautobahn 656|A 656]] commences just west of the city, connecting Heidelberg with [[Mannheim]]. Both highways meet at Heidelberg autobahn intersection in the city of Heidelberg, and the A 656 connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] at the Mannheim autobahn intersection, which connects to the east towards [[Stuttgart]].

Furthermore, the [[Bundesstraße 3|B 3]] (Frankfurt–Karlsruhe) runs north–south through the town, and the B 37 (Mannheim–[[Eberbach (Baden)|Eberbach]]) runs east–west. Both meet in the city center at the Bismarckplatz. The [[Bundesstraße 535|B 535]] begin in the south of Heidelberg and runs to Schwetzingen.

====Tourist roads====
Heidelberg is located on four tourist roads: [[Bergstraße Route|Bergstraße]], [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]], [[Castle Road]], and Straße der Demokratie (Road of Democracy).

===Railways===
[[Heidelberg Central Station]] (Hauptbahnhof) is on the [[Rhine Valley Railway]] and is served by [[Intercity-Express]], [[EuroCity in Germany|Euro City]] trains. This station is served by the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]]. There is also a station for [[intercity bus service]]s outside the central station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/heidelberg|title=Heidelberg: Stations|publisher= Travelinho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public transport===
[[File:Heidelberg - EC - 2018-07-20 12-36-59.jpg|thumb|DB train [[Heidelberg Hauptbahnhof]]]]

The main transport hub of Heidelberg is the Bismarckplatz. Several main thoroughfares of the city intersect here and one of the longest pedestrian streets in Europe, the Hauptstraße (main street) runs from here through the entire old town of Heidelberg. Heidelberg Central Station was nearby for many years, which was a combined terminal and through station. In 1955, it was moved about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km further to the west, which removed the necessity for trains continuing to the south or from the south to the north to reverse. The new central station became the second major transport hub of Heidelberg.

Heidelberg has had a public transport service since 1883, when horse-drawn trams were established. Due to the rapidly rising patronage it was decided on 20 December 1901 to convert the [[Trams in Heidelberg|Heidelberg tramway network]] to electrical operation. On 16 March 1902, the first electric tram ran on Rohrbacher Straße, sharing use of the suburban tracks built by the ''Deutsche Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'' in 1901 between Heidelberg and [[Wiesloch]]. Until the 1950s, the tram network was expanded a bit at a time. The rapidly growing popularity of car transport presented the operator of the trams with increasingly difficult problems and the tram network was gradually dismantled. It was not until 10 December 2006 that the network was extended again with the opening of a new tram line from [[Heidelberg-Kirchheim|Kirchheim]]. Tram and bus services are now operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (RNV). Since 1989, all fares are set under a uniform scheme by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar Transport Association, VRN). [[Carsharing]] increasingly provides a complement to public transport. More than 50 car-sharing stations are available to users in 12 of the 14 districts of Heidelberg offering a total of more than 100 cars.
[[File:Heidelberg - Bombardier RNV6 - RNV 4144 und RNV 4140 - 2016-08-25 14-39-04.jpg|thumb|Trams in Heidelberg]]

Since 14 December 2003, Heidelberg has been connected to the network of the [[Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn]], which opens up the entire Rhine-Neckar region, with lines connecting with the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], the [[Saarland]] and southern [[Hesse]].

The [[Heidelberger Bergbahn]] (Heidelberg Mountain Railway) has run since 2005 with new cars on the lower part from Kornmarkt to Molkenkur and historic cars built in 1907 on the upper section of the [[funicular]] from Molkenkur to [[Königstuhl (Odenwald)|Königstuhl]]. It is one of the most popular means to reach [[Heidelberg Castle]]. The first plans for the funicular were drawn up in 1873. Due to a lack of funds was the first section of the funicular was not opened until 1890. In 2004, the upper section of the funicular was listed as part of the heritage of the state of Baden-Württemberg.

===United States military installations===
{{see also|United States Army Garrison Heidelberg}}
[[File:Behoerdenzentrum Heidelberg.jpg|thumb|right|Behördenzentrum Heidelberg]]
During World War II, Heidelberg was one of the few major cities in Germany not significantly damaged by Allied bombing. Situated in the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|American Zone]] of Germany, Heidelberg became the headquarters of the American forces in Europe. The main military facilities were [[Campbell Barracks]], the former Wehrmacht Grossdeutschland-Kaserne, which housed the US Army, Europe ([[USAREUR]]) and [[NATO]]'s Component Command-Land Headquarters. (Until 2004, this was designated Joint Headquarters Centre, and before that, LANDCENT).

Campbell Barracks and [[Mark Twain Village]] were both in Südstadt; Patton Barracks was in nearby Kirchheim. Nachrichten Kaserne in Rohrbach was home to the former Heidelberg Army Hospital, later designated the Heidelberg Health Center. [[Patrick Henry Village]], the largest U.S. military housing area in the Heidelberg area, was west of Kirchheim. These installations, including Tompkins Barracks and Kilbourne Kaserne in nearby Schwetzingen, plus the Germersheim Depot, made up the U.S. Army Garrison Heidelberg. Tompkins Barracks was home to [http://www.imcom-europe.army.mil U.S. Army Installation Management Command Europe Region.] The Heidelberg U.S. Army Air Field (Heidelberg AAF) was converted to a&lt;s&gt;n&lt;/s&gt; heliport (mostly Blackhawk Helicopters) after the [[NATO]] [[Kosovo]] campaign.
[[File:Heidelberg Bahnstadt Langer Anger 2.JPG|thumb|left|The New city district of Heidelberg, [[Bahnstadt]], is one of the biggest [[passive house]] settlements in the world]]
The children of [[United States Department of Defense]] employees based in Heidelberg attended on-base schools operated by the DODDS-E (Department of Defense Dependents Schools&amp;nbsp;– Europe). There were three schools of this kind: [[Heidelberg High School]] in Mark Twain Village (Mark Twain Elementary School closed at the completion of the 2010–2011 school year), and [[Heidelberg Middle School]] and Patrick Henry Elementary in Patrick Henry Village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eu.dodea.edu/schools/index.php?dId=2 Our Districts and Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814052444/http://www.eu.dodea.edu/schools/index.php?dId=2 |date=August 14, 2012 }} Dependents Schools Europe website, accessed: April 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2009, the U.S. Army announced that it would be building new headquarters for USAREUR in [[Wiesbaden]]. The move from Heidelberg took place in 2012 and 2013, and was completed in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bw.eur.army.mil/news/HPpdf/2010/July_1_2010.pdf Heidelberg, Mannheim to close by 2015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330175747/http://www.bw.eur.army.mil/news/HPpdf/2010/July_1_2010.pdf |date=March 30, 2012 }}, HeraldPost Vol. 35 No. 38, accessed: October 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015 all United States forces had left Heidelberg. The barracks and the housing areas were returned to the German state for conversion to civilian use.

==Culture==
===Events===

[[File:Heidelberg night.jpg|thumb|right|Heidelberg with the Old Bridge illuminated]]
Several festivals and events hosted and organized in Heidelberg throughout the year. In February, the ''Ball der Vampire'' (Ball of the Vampires)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/content/e904/e911/e7697/index_ger.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030032923/http://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/content/e904/e911/e7697/index_ger.html|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is arranged and [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|Fasching]], the equivalent of Mardis Gras or Carnival in some German regions, with a giant vampire-themed costume party at the local castle or city hall is celebrated. In March or April the ''Heidelberger Frühling'' (Heidelberg Spring), the Classic Music Festival and the international Easter egg market are conducted. During the last weekend of April there is an annually organized half marathon. In the summertime there are the ''Frühlingsmesse'' on the Messeplatz (May) and Illumination of the castle and bridge with lights and fireworks take place. In September, on the last Saturday the ''Old Town Autumn Festival'' is held.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heidelberg-marketing.de/en/events/highlights/heidelberger-herbst.html|title=Heidelberger Herbst|website=www.heidelberg-marketing.de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a Medieval Market, an arts and crafts market, a flea market, and music from Samba to Rock. During October or November there are the ''Heidelberger Theater Days'' and the [[Enjoy Jazz]] festival. Every year in November the [[International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg]] take place in the city, too. The festival presents arthouse films of international newcomer directors and is held jointly by both of the cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mannheim-filmfestival.com/ |title=Internationales FilmFestival Mannheim-Heidelberg &amp;#124; |publisher=Mannheim-filmfestival.com |date=2012-10-18 |access-date=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Christmas there is a Christmas market throughout the oldest part of the city. A famous gift is the chocolate called Heidelberger ''Studentenkuss'' (student kiss).

===Cinemas===

The nationwide trend of cinema closures hit Heidelberg harder than many other places in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/heidelberg_artikel,-rnz-HDKreis-Der-angekuendigte-Tod-des-Heidelberger-Kinos-_arid,56873.html|title=Der angekündigte Tod des Heidelberger Kinos|website=www.rnz.de|language=de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.heidelberg.de/stadtblatt-online/index.php?artikel_id=8453&amp;bf=|title=Stadt Heidelberg - Stadtblatt Online|website=ww2.heidelberg.de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://2006-2013.ruprecht.de/nachrichten/archive/2011/may/22/article/kinosterben-geht-weiter/|title=Kinosterben geht weiter|website=2006-2013.ruprecht.de|language=de|access-date=2019-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years saw the low-point of this development, when in this city of over 150,000 people there were just three small cinemas left, with a total capacity of under 450 seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.film-krise-in-heidelberg-in-der-kinohochburg-geht-bald-das-licht-aus-page1.be520c8b-3a58-4d93-a41b-a7c017e2339f.html|title=Film-Krise in Heidelberg: Dem Kinosterben soll entgegnet werden|first=Stuttgarter Zeitung, Stuttgart|last=Germany|website=stuttgarter-zeitung.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation has slightly improved since late 2017, when Heidelberg got a new multiplex adjacent to the new Bahnstadt development, the "Luxor Filmpalast".

Luxor shows mainly [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|Blockbuster movies]] in [[German language|German]], but some showings in [[English language|English]] are on offer for selected films.&lt;ref&gt;heidelberg-bahnstadt-teileroeffnung-vom-kino-luxor-filmpalast-am-23-november-9388433.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The small 2-screen cinema "Gloria/Gloriette" (Old Town), together with the affiliated "Kamera" (Neuenheim) offers arthouse and independent films, with some showings being offered in the films original language, usually with German subtitles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gloria-kamera-kinos.de/original-versions.php|title=GLORIA - GLORIETTE - DIE KAMERA &amp;#124; Original Versions|website=www.gloria-kamera-kinos.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit "Karlstorkino" (at the far eastern edge of the Old Town, next to the river) offers international arthouse fare and the occasional documentary. The vast majority of non-German films at this cinema are shown in their original language with either English or German subtitles, depending on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.karlstorkino.de/originalversions/|title=Original Versions / Originalversionen|website=www.karlstorkino.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums and exhibitions===
Among the most prominent museums of Heidelberg are for instance the Carl Bosch Museum which shows life and work of chemist and Nobel Prize-winner [[Carl Bosch]]. Then there is the [[Documentation and Culture Centre of German Sinti and Roma]] (Dokumentations- und Kulturzentrum Deutscher Sini und Roma) describing the Nazi genocide of the [[Sinti]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] peoples. The German Packing Museum (Deutsches Verpackungsmuseum) gives an overview of the history of packing and wrapping goods, whereas the German Pharmacy Museum (Deutsches Apothekenmuseum) which is located in the castle illustrates the history of Pharmacy in Germany. The [[Kurpfälzisches Museum]] (Palatinate Museum) offers a great art collection and some Roman archeological artifacts from the region. In honour of [[Friedrich Ebert]] the [[President Friedrich Ebert Memorial]], which commemorates the life of Germany's first democratic head of state, was established. Besides, there are guided tours in most of the historical monuments of Heidelberg, as well as organized tourist tours through the city available in several languages.

===Heidelberg Romanticism&lt;!--movement names are capitalized (cf. 'German Romanticism'); 'Heidelberg Romanticism', 'Heidelberg romanticism', 'Heidelberg Romantics' and 'Heidelberg romantics' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Carl Philipp Fohr 001.jpg|thumb|Romantic view of [[Heidelberg Castle]] ruins]]
Heidelberg was the centre of the epoch of ''Romantik'' ([[German Romanticism|Romanticism]]) in Germany. The phase after [[Jena Romanticism]] is often called '''Heidelberg Romanticism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (see also [[Berlin Romanticism]]). There was a famous circle of poets (the '''Heidelberg Romantics'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;), such as [[Joseph von Eichendorff]], [[Johann Joseph von Görres]], [[Ludwig Achim von Arnim]], and [[Clemens Brentano]]. A relic of Romanticism is the Philosophers' Walk ({{lang-de|link=no|Philosophenweg}}), a scenic walking path on the nearby Heiligenberg, overlooking Heidelberg.

The ''Romantik'' epoch of German philosophy and literature, was described as a movement against classical and realistic theories of literature, a contrast to the rationality of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It elevated medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be from the medieval period. It also emphasized folk art, nature and an epistemology based on nature, which included human activity conditioned by nature in the form of language, custom and usage.

===Old Heidelberg===
{{Further|Alt Heidelberg (play)}}
In 1901 [[Wilhelm Meyer-Förster]] wrote the play ''[[Old Heidelberg (play)|Old Heidelberg]]'' which was followed by a large number of film adaptations. It was the basis for [[Sigmund Romberg]]'s 1924 operetta ''[[The Student Prince]]'' which was itself turned into a [[The Student Prince (film)|film of the same title]].

===I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg===
{{Further|I Lost My Heart in Heidelberg (song)}}

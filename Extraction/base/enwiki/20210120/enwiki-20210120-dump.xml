He later described his father as "a merchant of chaos",&lt;ref name= parade&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_04-09-2006/Tom_Cruise_cover|title=I Can Create Who I Am|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=April 9, 2006|access-date=February 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060632/http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_04-09-2006/Tom_Cruise_cover|archive-date=April 12, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "bully", and a "coward" who beat his children. He elaborated, "[My father] was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'"&lt;ref name= parade /&gt;

Cruise spent part of his childhood in Canada. When his father took a job as a defense consultant with the [[Canadian Armed Forces]], his family moved in late 1971 to [[Beacon Hill, Ottawa]].&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex&gt;{{cite book|url=http://i.usatoday.net/life/books/tom_cruise_excerpt.pdf | title= Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography| first= Andrew |last= Morton| series= Ch. 1| publisher= Macmillan| date= January 15, 2008| access-date= October 13, 2016| isbn= 9781429933902}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the new [[Robert Hopkins Public School]] for his fourth and fifth grade education.&lt;ref name= Unauthorized_ex /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= ocdsb.ca| publisher= Ottawa-Carleton District School Board| url= http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/RHOP.pdf| title= Robert Hopkins School Profile| access-date= September 25, 2012| url-status=dead| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117025444/http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/RHOP.pdf| archive-date= January 17, 2013| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first became involved in drama in fourth grade, under the tutelage of George Steinburg.

==Career==
===Acting===
[[File:1985 Tom Cruise.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Cruise in 1985 at a reception hosted by First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[White House]]]]
At age 18,&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/tom-cruise-biography-filmography|title=Tom Cruise Biography, Filmography|date=March 25, 2015|website=Fox News|access-date=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, Cruise moved to New York City to pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name="cnbc.com"/&gt; After working as a [[busboy]] in New York, he went to Los Angeles to try out for television roles. He signed with [[Creative Artists Agency|CAA]] and began acting in films.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt; He first appeared in a [[bit part]] in the 1981 film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]]'', followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'' later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''. That same year he appeared in ''[[All the Right Moves (film)|All the Right Moves]]'' and ''[[Risky Business]]'', which has been described as "A [[Generation X]] classic, and a career maker for Tom Cruise".&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017641-risky_business/ |title=Risky Business|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also played the male lead in the [[Ridley Scott]] film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'', released in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 9, 2015|title=Ridley Scott's beautiful dark twisted fantasy: the making of Legend|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/legend-ridley-scott/tom-cruise-making-of/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1986's ''[[Top Gun]]'', his status as a [[superstar]] cemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Tony Scott| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19316140|access-date=October 9, 2015|newspaper=BBC News|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tom cruise 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|Tom Cruise at the 61st [[Academy Awards]] in 1989]]
Cruise followed up ''Top Gun'' with ''[[The Color of Money]]'', which came out the same year, and which paired him with  [[Paul Newman]]. 1988 saw him star in ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', which earned him a nomination for the [[Razzie Award for Worst Actor]]. Later that year he starred with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Rain Man]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Film]] and Cruise the Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Ron Kovic]] in 1989's ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'', which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama]], the [[Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor]], the [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.

Cruise's next films were ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990) and ''[[Far and Away]]'' (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife [[Nicole Kidman]] as his love interest, followed by the [[legal thriller]] ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'', which was a critical and commercial success. In 1994, Cruise starred along with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Christian Slater]] in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'', a gothic drama/horror film that was based on [[Anne Rice]]'s [[Interview with the Vampire|best-selling novel]]. The film was well-received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as [[Julian Sands]] was her first choice. Upon seeing the film, however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305073,00.html Go Figure], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy [[Ethan Hunt]] in the reboot of ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', which he produced. It was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the Jim Phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/reviews?start=10|title=Mission: Impossible Reviews &amp; Ratings – IMDb|work=IMDb|access-date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he took on the title role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', for which he earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] and his second nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]]. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', and took a rare [[Supporting actor|supporting role]], as a motivational speaker, Frank T.J. Mackey, in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', for which he received another [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]].

In 2000, Cruise returned as [[Ethan Hunt]] in the second installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' films, ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]''. The film was helmed by Hong Kong director [[John Woo]] and branded with his [[gun fu]] style, and continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures. Like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. Cruise received an [[MTV Movie Award]] for Best Male Performance for this film.

His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise&gt;{{cite web| url= https://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=tomcruise.htm |title=Tom Cruise |website=Boxofficemojo.com |access-date= April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tom_cruise/ |title=Tom Cruise Movies, News, and Pictures on Rotten Tomatoes |website=Rottentomatoes.com |access-date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001) with [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Penélope Cruz]]. In 2002, Cruise starred in the [[dystopia]]n science fiction action film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' which was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on the science fiction short story by [[Philip K. Dick]].
[[File:TomCruiseOct07.jpg|thumb|upright|Cruise at the 2007 [[London Film Festival]] for the premiere of ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'']]
In 2003, he starred in [[Edward Zwick]]'s period action drama ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', for which he received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor. In 2004, Cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as Vincent in ''[[Collateral (film)|Collateral]]'', directed by [[Michael Mann]]. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[H. G. Wells]] [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]], which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with US$591.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven [[Saturn Awards]] between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise/&gt;

In 2006, he returned to his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' film series, ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''. The film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mi3.htm |title=Mission: Impossible III (2006) |website= Box Office Mojo |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as "Les Grossman" in the 2008 comedy ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' with [[Ben Stiller]], [[Jack Black]], and [[Robert Downey Jr.]]  This performance earned Cruise a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=valkyrie.htm |title=Valkyrie (2008) |website= Box Office Mojo |date=April 16, 2009 |access-date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing===
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent [[Paula Wagner]] to form [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] in 1993,&lt;ref name="MGM"&gt;{{cite news|title=MGM Partners With Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner to Form New United Artists |url= http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios |date=November 2, 2006 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115013/http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |archive-date= September 29, 2008 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] as "one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood." Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.&lt;ref name="Epstein"&gt;{{cite web| last= Epstein |first=Edward Jay|author-link=Edward Jay Epstein|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121617/ |title=Tom Cruise Inc. |website= Slate.com|access-date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller ''[[The Devil in the White City]]'' about a real-life serial killer, [[H. H. Holmes]], at Chicago's [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. [[Kathryn Bigelow]] is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s production company, [[Appian Way Productions|Appian Way]], is also developing a film about Holmes and the [[World's Fair]], in which DiCaprio will star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |title=The Devil In The White City movie, trailer, review, pics, pictures, poster, news, DVD|website=Thezreview.co.uk |access-date=October 31, 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080705065258/http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |archive-date = July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise has produced several films in which he appeared. He produced ''Mission: Impossible, ''[[Without Limits]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'', ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'', ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/|title=Tom Cruise Production Credits|website=IMDb.com|access-date=January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Break with Paramount====
On August 22, 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', chairman of [[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]] (Paramount's parent company) [[Sumner Redstone]] cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://money.cnn.com/2006/08/22/news/newsmakers/cruise_paramount/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=CNN: Paramount Pictures cuts ties with Tom Cruise |publisher=CNN  |date=August 23, 2006 |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015319/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 30, 2007 |title=Sumner Redstone Rebuke of Tom Cruise: Now What? |publisher=National Ledger |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from [[private equity]] firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman |first=David |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-08-23-hedge-films-usat_x.htm |title=Cruise seeks financial backing from hedge funds |work=USA Today |date=August 24, 2006 |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the ''Mission: Impossible'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d817b680-33a0-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html|title=Paramount vs Cruise: all down to the killer cut| work=Financial Times|access-date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicole |last=Sperling |url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |title=Biz eyeing economics of Cruise-Par breakup: DVD slowdown forcing restraint |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 24, 2006 |access-date=August 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113093430/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |archive-date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio [[United Artists]].&lt;ref name="MGM"/&gt; Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive.

Production began in 2007 of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007, Cruise signed to play [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], the [[protagonist]]. This project marked the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]] and starring Redford, [[Meryl Streep]] and Cruise. ''Lambs'' was released on November 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120712180209/http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |url-status=dead |archive-date= July 12, 2012 |title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler |website=Newsmax.com |date=March 21, 2007 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[https://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/14/business/fi-wagner14 Paula Wagner plans to step down at United Artists], an August 2008 article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise met his second wife, actress [[Nicole Kidman]], on the set of their film ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990). The couple married on December 24, 1990. They adopted two children: Isabella Jane (born 1992) and Connor Antony (born 1995). In February 2001, Cruise filed for divorce from Kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. In 2007, Kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to Cruise, saying that it was wrongly reported and explaining that she had actually had an [[ectopic pregnancy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon |first=Meryl |url=http://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity-lifestyle/celebrities/Nicole-Kidman-Interview-3 |title=Nicole Kidman Tells It Like It Is |work=Marie Claire |date=November 11, 2007 |access-date=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spaceflight mission===
Cruise is sponsored for an upcoming spaceflight mission on the [[SpaceX Axiom Space-1|SpaceX AX-1]] mission in late 2021, as part of a project to film an upcoming unnamed movie in space on board the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.nme.com/news/film/tom-cruise-is-officially-going-to-space-for-his-next-movie-2758685| title= Tom Cruise is officially going to space for his next movie| website= NME.com| first= Ella| last= Kemp| date= 22 September 2020| access-date= 1 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientology===
[[File:Tom Cruise and Mimi Rogers.jpg|thumb|Cruise and Mimi Rogers at the 1989 Oscars]]
Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the [[Church of Scientology]] and its associated social programs. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, [[Mimi Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1791617.stm |title=Cruise lobbies over Scientology|work=BBC News |date=January 30, 2002 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise struggled with [[dyslexia]] at an early age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140587,00.html|title=Tom Cruise: My Struggle to Read|website=People.com|access-date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that Scientology, specifically the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Study Tech]], helped him overcome dyslexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruise credits Scientology for his success| work=Today.com| date= May 24, 2005 |url= https://www.today.com/popculture/cruise-credits-scientology-his-success-wbna7968809| access-date= May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advocacy of Scientology====
In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]]. They described him as a militant spokesman for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/story.asp?j=182470131&amp;p=y8z47x994&amp;n=182471074&amp;x= |title=Paris snubs Scientology 'militant' Cruise |work=Irish Examiner|date=July 13, 2005 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.prgparis.org/node/57 |language= fr| title= Tom Cruise ne sera pas citoyen d'honneur de Paris| place= Paris| agency= AFP| trans-title= Tom Cruise will not be an honorary citizen of Paris| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425091546/http://www.prgparis.org/node/57 |archive-date=April 25, 2012 |date= July 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise co-founded and raised donations for [[Downtown Medical]] to offer New York City [[9/11]] rescue workers [[Purification Rundown|detoxification therapy]] based on the works of L. Ron Hubbard. This drew criticism from the medical profession&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= O'Donnell| first= Michelle |date= October 4, 2003| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/04/nyregion/04DETO.html| title= Scientologist's Treatments Lure Firefighters| work= The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger |last=Friedman |title=Tom Cruise Can't Put Out These Fires |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,238238,00.html#2 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 22, 2006 |access-date=December 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070109070250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0%2C2933%2C238238%2C00.html |archive-date=January 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For such activities, Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] created the Scientology Freedom Medal of Valor and awarded it to Cruise in late 2004.&lt;ref name="vanity"&gt;{{cite web |title= What Katie Didn't Know |work= [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date= October 2012 |first= Maureen |last= Orth |url= https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2012/10/katie-holmes-divorce-scientology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of psychiatry====
In January 2004, Cruise made the controversial statement "I think psychiatry should be outlawed."&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;{{cite journal |last=Desai|first=Nimesh|title=Antipsychiatry: Meeting the challenge|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]] |date=October–December 2005|volume=47|issue=4|pages=185–187|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.43048|pmid=20711302|pmc=2921130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress [[Brooke Shields]] for using the drug [[Paxil]] (paroxetine), an [[anti-depressant]] to which Shields attributes her recovery from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of [[pseudoscience]]. Shields responded that Cruise "should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brooke Shields Lashes Out at Tom Cruise| url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1067822,00.html|date=June 2, 2005|work= People  |location= New York City|access-date=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a heated argument between [[Matt Lauer]] and Cruise on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/8344309/ |title= In tense moment, Cruise calls Lauer 'glib'| website=[[NBC News]]| date= June 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical authorities view Cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Psychotropic drugs: unhelpful and helpful comments| journal=[[The Lancet]] | publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=London |volume=366| issue=9480| page=96| date= July 9, 2005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66841-9 | pmid= 16010708| last1=The Lancet | s2cid=39293746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shields herself called Cruise's comments "a disservice to mothers everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shields |first= Brooke |author-link=Brooke Shields |work= The New York Times|title=War of Words |date=July 1, 2005 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/01/opinion/01shields.html | access-date=January 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late August 2006, Cruise apologized in person to Shields for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Shields: Cruise apology was 'heartfelt' |url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-02-shields-cruise_x.htm|date=September 2, 2006|work=[[USA Today]]|agency=Associated Press |access-date=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the [[psychoactive drug]]s which are routinely prescribed for treatment.&lt;ref name="vanity"/&gt;  It was reported that Cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director Steven Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20050930235723/http://entertainment.myway.com/celebgossip/pgsix/id/09_21_2005_1.html| title=Spielberg in Cruise Meltdown|archive-date=September 30, 2005|work=myway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spielberg had reportedly mentioned in Cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. Shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by Scientologists, reportedly angering Spielberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/07/24/hollywood-ending| title=Hollywood Ending|first= Ken |last= Auletta|date=July 24, 2006|work= [[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====YouTube video removal====
{{main|Project Chanology#Tom Cruise video}}
On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on YouTube, showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.&lt;ref name="warne"&gt;{{cite news | last =Warne | first =Dan | title ='Anonymous' threatens to 'dismantle' Church of Scientology via internet | work=[[APC Magazine]] | publisher=[[National Nine News]] | date =January 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="knbc"&gt;{{cite news | title =Hacker Group Declares War On Scientology: Group Upset Over Church's Handling Of Tom Cruise Video | publisher=[[KNBC]] |location=Los Angeles| date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.knbc.com/news/15132759/detail.html | access-date =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology said the video had been "pirated and edited," and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.&lt;ref name="knbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid"&gt;{{cite news | title =Report: Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid for Publishing Comments Comparing Tom Cruise to Nazi Minister | publisher =[[Fox News]] | date =January 23, 2008 | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | access-date =January 25, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090605211418/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | archive-date =June 5, 2009 | url-status=dead | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.&lt;ref name="vamosi anonymous hackers"&gt;{{cite news | last =Vamosi | first =Robert | title =Anonymous hackers take on the Church of Scientology | work=[[CNET News]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. | date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.news.com/8301-10789_3-9857666-57.html | access-date =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After YouTube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the [[fair use]] clause. It was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of June 2020, the video has achieved over 14 million views. YouTube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBZ_uAbxS0 |title= Tom Cruise Scientology Video – (Original UNCUT)| via= YouTube |date= January 17, 2008| access-date= July 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology's purported influence on Cruise====
{{see also|#Personal life}}
In 2013, Cruise stated that ex-wife Katie Holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter Suri from Scientology. He also said that Suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tom Cruise Admits Katie Holmes Divorced Him To Protect Suri From Scientology|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/08/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-protect-suri-scientology_n_4240715.html?ir=Entertainment | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | first=Stephanie|last=Marcus|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley, resigned. Cruise's next publicist was Lee Anne DeVette, Cruise's sister, who was herself a Scientologist. She served in that role until November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932447?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Cruise will go with pro|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Chris|last=Gardner|date= November 6, 2005|access-date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm [[Rogers &amp; Cowan|Rogers and Cowan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/eo/20051108/113151894008.html|title=Cruise Control Shifts Gears|date=November 8, 2005|work=Yahoo!

The 2015 documentary ''[[Going Clear (film)|Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief]]'' cast a spotlight on Cruise's role in Scientology. The film alleges that Cruise used [[Sea Org]] workers as a source of free labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cruises-secret-scientology-girlfriend-nazanin-boniadi-2015-3|title=Tom Cruise's secret Scientology girlfriend Nazanin Boniadi|date=April 1, 2015|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Cruise's former auditor [[Marty Rathbun]] claims that wife [[Nicole Kidman]] was wiretapped on Tom Cruise's suggestion, which Cruise's lawyer denies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/11370754/Scientology-leaders-ordered-Nicole-Kidman-wiretap-during-Tom-Cruise-marriage.html|title=Scientology leaders 'ordered Nicole Kidman wiretap' during Tom Cruise marriage|date=January 26, 2015|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/618897/controversial-scientology-documentary-alleges-tom-cruise-wiretapped-nicole-kidman-s-phone-church-slams-claims|title=Controversial Scientology Documentary Alleges Tom Cruise Wiretapped Nicole Kidman's Phone, Church Slams Claims|work=E!

[[File:Cruise (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|Cruise in 2010]]
In 2006, ''Premiere'' ranked Cruise as Hollywood's most powerful actor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power List 2006|url=http://www.premiere.com/best/2816/the-power-list-2006.html|work=Premiere|date=June 2006|access-date=July 29, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120121741/http://www.premiere.com/best/2816/the-power-list-2006.html|archive-date=January 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 Power List, being the highest ranked actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.premiere.com/newsletter/2851/the-power-list-2006-page13.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120122143/http://www.premiere.com/newsletter/2851/the-power-list-2006-page13.html | archive-date=January 20, 2007 | title=The Power List 2006 | work=Premiere | access-date=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/6YG2.html| title=Tom Cruise ranked 1 among The Top 100 Celebrities In 2006|work=Forbes |access-date=May 1, 2007|date=May 1, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617132837/http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/6YG2.html|archive-date=June 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of [[CinemaScore]] in 2016 cited Cruise and Leonardo DiCaprio as the "two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up".&lt;ref name="lawrence20160830"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/neon/las-vegan-s-polling-company-keeps-tabs-hollywood |title=Las Vegan's polling company keeps tabs on Hollywood |last=Lawrence |first=Christopher |date=August 30, 2016 |newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/tom-cruise-eyes-wide-shut-mission-impossible-top-gun-jack-reacher-a9177726.html|title=Why Tom Cruise is contemporary cinema's Peter Pan|date=October 31, 2019|website=The Independent|access-date=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

October 10, 2006, was declared "Tom Cruise Day" in Japan; the Japan Memorial Day Association said that he was awarded with a special day because of "his love for and close association with Japan." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Cruise_Day_Declared_in_Japan/3563377 |title=Tom Cruise Day |website=Hollywood.com |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While reviewing ''[[Days of Thunder]]'', film critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted the similarities between several of Cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the Tom Cruise Picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/days-of-thunder-1990|title=Days Of Thunder movie review &amp; film summary (1990) &amp;#124; Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com|access-date=May 21, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert listed nine key ingredients that make up the Tom Cruise Picture; the Cruise character, the mentor, the superior woman, the craft he must hone, the arena it takes place in, the arcana or knowledge he must learn, the trail or journey, the proto enemy, and the eventual enemy of the character. Some of Cruise's later films like ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' and ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' can also be considered to be part of this formula.

''Widescreenings'' compares two of these Cruise characters in an article on the film ''[[A Few Good Men]]'',&lt;blockquote&gt;
[screenwriter] [[Aaron Sorkin]] interestingly takes the opposite approach of ''[[Top Gun]]'', where Cruise also starred as the protagonist. In ''Top Gun'', Cruise plays Mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. Where Maverick Mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, Daniel Kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.&lt;ref name="widescreenings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenings.com/few-good-men-analysis-review.html|title=Review and analysis: A Few Good Men|first=Inspired by R.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Litigation==
In 1998, Tom Cruise successfully sued the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a [[sham marriage|sham]] designed to cover up his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/203779.stm |title=Cruise and Kidman win libel case |work=BBC News |date=October 29, 1998 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise won the libel case.{{Citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In May 2001, Cruise filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor Chad Slater. Slater had told the celebrity magazine ''[[Actustar]]'' that he had been involved in an affair with Cruise. This claim was strongly denied by Cruise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Simon|title=Cruise sues porn star over gay love claims|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1329163/Cruise-sues-porn-star-over-gay-love-claims.html|access-date=May 6, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=May 4, 2001|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Slater was later ordered to pay $10&amp;nbsp;million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. Cruise requested a default judgment and, in January 2003, a Los Angeles judge decided against Slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2664159.stm |title=Cruise wins 'gay' claims legal battle |work=BBC News |date=January 16, 2003 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Stephen|last=Silverman|url=https://people.com/celebrity/cruise-wins-10-million-in-gay-lawsuit/ |title=Cruise Wins $10 Million in Gay Lawsuit |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 16, 2003 |access-date=February 17, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise also sued ''Bold Magazine'' publisher Michael Davis for $100&amp;nbsp;million, because Davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1686039.stm |title=Cruise gay claims dropped |work=BBC News |date=December 1, 2001 |access-date=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Cruise sued [[cybersquatting|cybersquatter]] Jeff Burgar to obtain control of the TomCruise.com domain name. When owned by Burgar, the domain redirected to information about Cruise on Celebrity1000.com. The decision to turn TomCruise.com over to Cruise was handed down by the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) on July 5, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Arbitration and Mediation Center |url=http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2006/d2006-0560.html |title=WIPO Domain Name Decision: D2006-0560 |website=Arbiter.wipo.int |date=July 5, 2006 |access-date=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Michael Davis Sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at Cruise's behest. That suit was dismissed by a Central Civil West court judge in Los Angeles on the grounds that the [[statute of limitations]] had expired on Sapir's claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-07-06/tom-cruise-accused-of-wiretap-conspiracy-with-convicted-criminal-anthony-pellicano-during-nicole-kidman-divorce-exclusive/|title=Tom Cruise Accused of Wiretap Conspiracy With Convicted Criminal Anthony Pellicano During Nicole Kidman Divorce|work=Celebuzz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/tom-cruise-bert-fields-win-dismissal-wiretapping-suit-81691/|title=Tom Cruise, Bert Fields Win Dismissal of Pellicano Wiretapping Suit|work=TheWrap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Cruise filed a lawsuit against ''[[In Touch Weekly|In Touch]]'' and ''[[Life &amp; Style (magazine)|Life &amp; Style]]'' magazines for [[defamation]] after they claimed Cruise had "abandoned" his six-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.tmz.com/2012/10/24/tom-cruise-50-million-dollar-lawsuit-life-and-style-abandoned-suri/ | title=Tom Cruise Files $50 Mil Lawsuit Over Mag Claiming He Abandoned Suri  | date=October 24, 2012 |work=TMZ | access-date=October 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During deposition, Cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without him seeing her.

'''''Mission: Impossible''''' is an American  television series created and initially produced by [[Bruce Geller]], chronicling the exploits of a team of secret government agents known as the [[Impossible Missions Force]]. In the first season, the team is led by [[Dan Briggs (Mission: Impossible)|Dan Briggs]], played by [[Steven Hill]]; Jim Phelps takes charge for the remaining seasons, played by [[Peter Graves]]. Each episode opens with a fast-paced montage of shots from that episode, which unfolds as the series' [[Theme from Mission: Impossible|theme music]] plays, composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], after which Briggs or Phelps receives his instructions from a voice delivered on a recording, which then destroys itself.

The series was financed and filmed by [[Desilu Productions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://badassdigest.com/2013/09/08/how-lucille-ball-made-star-trek-happen/|title=How Lucille Ball Made STAR TREK Happen|author=Devin Faraci|work=Birth.Movies.Death.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aired on [[CBS]] from September 1966 to March 1973. It was  [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|revived in 1988]] for two seasons on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], retaining only Graves in the cast. It also inspired a [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|series of theatrical motion pictures]] starring [[Tom Cruise]] beginning in 1996.

== Overview ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
The series follows the exploits of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), a small team of secret agents used for covert missions against dictators, evil organizations, and (primarily in later episodes) crime lords. On occasion, the IMF also mounts unsanctioned, private missions on behalf of its members.

The identities of the higher echelons of the organization that oversees the IMF are never revealed. Only rare cryptic bits of information are ever provided during the life of the series, such as in the third-season mission "Nicole", where the IMF leader states that his instructions come from "Division Seven". In the 1980s revival,  the IMF is suggested to be an independent agency of the United States government.  This is implied by the fact that towards the end of the taped instructed messages, the narrator includes the passage:-  "As always, should you or any of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions", or words to that effect.

=== IMF agents ===
[[File:Steven Hill Dan Briggs Martin Landau Mission Impossible 1966.JPG|thumb|150px|Steven Hill, as Dan Briggs, and Martin Landau, as the target that agent Rollin Hand will impersonate, in the premiere episode]]
The leader of the IMF is initially Dan Briggs, played by Steven Hill. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], Hill had to leave on Fridays at 4 pm to be home before sundown and was not available until after dark the next day. Although his contract allowed for filming interruptions due to religious observances, the clause proved difficult to work around due to the production schedule, and as the season progressed, an increasing number of episodes featured little of Briggs. Hill had other problems, as well. After cooperatively crawling through dirt tunnels and repeatedly climbing a rope ladder in the episode "Snowball in Hell", in the following episode ("Action!") he balked at climbing to the rafters via a 20-foot soundstage staircase and locked himself in his dressing room. Unable to come to terms with Hill, the producers reshot the episode without him (another character, Cinnamon Carter, listened to the taped message, the selected operatives' photos were displayed in "limbo", and the team meeting was held in another apartment), and reduced Briggs' presence in the five episodes left to be filmed to a minimum.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 98–99}} As far as Hill's religious requirements were concerned, line producer Joseph Gantman simply had not understood what had been agreed to. He told author Patrick J. White, "'If someone understands your problems and says he understands them, you feel better about it. But if he doesn't care about your problems, then you begin to really resent him. Steven Hill may have felt exactly the same way."{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 59}}

Hill was replaced without explanation to the audience after the first season by Peter Graves, playing the role of Jim Phelps, who remained the leader for the remainder of the original series and in the 1988–1990 revival.

[[File:Barbara Bain Mission Impossible 1969.JPG|thumb|180px|Barbara Bain as Cinnamon Carter, 1969]]
In theory, Briggs and Phelps are the only full-time members of the IMF. As the series was originally conceived, they would form teams made up of part-time agents who came from a variety of professions, choosing their operatives based on the particular skills necessary for the mission. In practice, however (especially after the first season), Briggs and especially Phelps would choose the same core group of three or four agents for every mission.  Still, many episodes also feature guest stars playing one-time additional agents who have special skills.

The regular agent line-up during the first season consisted of:
* [[Cinnamon Carter]] ([[Barbara Bain]]), a top fashion model and actress
* [[Barney Collier|Barnard "Barney" Collier]] ([[Greg Morris]]), a mechanical and electronics genius and owner of Collier Electronics
* [[Willy Armitage|William "Willy" Armitage]] ([[Peter Lupus]]), a world record-holding weight lifter 
* [[Rollin Hand]] ([[Martin Landau]]), a noted actor, makeup artist, escape artist, magician, and "man of a million faces"

Curiously, each of the agents had achieved a measure of celebrity in their chosen fields, and yet none of them — particularly Cinnamon and Rollin — were ever recognized by the targets of their missions.

[[File:Mission impossible cast 1970.JPG|thumb|The season-five (1970–1971) cast (left to right): Leonard Nimoy, Greg Morris, Lesley Ann Warren, Peter Lupus, and Peter Graves]]
Landau was billed as a "special guest star" during the first season; he had been cast as a guest star for the pilot with the understanding that he would be one of four or five rotating guest-star agents. His contract gave producers an option to have him "render services for (three or four) additional episodes". To fill the void left by Hill's Sabbath absences, producers wound up using Landau for more episodes, always as a "guest star". He eventually struck a deal to appear in all the first season's remaining episodes, but always billed as a "guest star" so  he could have the option to give notice to work on a feature film. Landau contractually became a series regular in season two.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 60}}

As actors left the series over time, others became regulars. Replacements often possessed the same skills as their predecessors. For example, "[[The Great Paris]]," Hand's replacement played by [[Leonard Nimoy]] in the fourth and fifth seasons, is also an actor, makeup artist, magician, and "master of disguise". Also seen in seasons five and six is [[Dr. Doug Robert]], played by [[Sam Elliott]] (according to White, the character was introduced as a replacement for Willy, but the idea was dropped once the producers realized how popular Willy was with viewers).

Cinnamon's "replacement" in season four was a series of guest stars, only one making more than one appearance: [[Lee Meriwether]] as Tracey. Season five had the addition of Dana Lambert, played by stage and movie actress [[Lesley Ann Warren]] (billed as "Lesley Warren"). In seasons six and seven, the female member of the team was cosmetologist and mistress-of-disguise Lisa Casey ([[Lynda Day George]]), whose first name was only established in the 1988–1989 revival. She was replaced in a third of the total season-seven episodes, during her maternity leave, by [[Mimi Davis]], played by [[Barbara Anderson (actress)|Barbara Anderson]], who had just come from the show ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]''.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 337}}

Morris and Lupus were the only actors to last through the full run of the original series. Morris also appeared in two episodes of the revival series, in which the character's son, Grant Collier (played by Morris's real-life son, [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]), is also an IMF agent.

=== Cold War subtext ===
Although a [[Cold War]] subtext is present throughout the series, the actual Cold War between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] is rarely mentioned over the course of the series. (See, for example, the mission objectives for "The Trial" and "The Confession" in season one.) However, in the early years, specific locations behind the Iron Curtain are named (such as [[Lubyanka prison]] in the episode "Memory") and many of the targets appear to be leaders of fictional [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries. Major named enemy countries include the "European People's Republic" and the "Eastern European Republic". Additionally, real languages spoken in Eastern Europe are used. In the season-one episode "The Carriers", one of the villains reads a book whose title is the (incorrect) Russian ''Na Voina'' (''[[On War|About War]]''); police vehicles are often labeled as such with words such as "poliiçia", and "poIiia", and a gas line or tank would be labeled "Gäz", which is a Romanian translation. This "language", referred to by the production team as "[[Bruce Geller|Gellerese]]", was invented specifically to be readable by nonspeakers of Slavic languages. Their generous use of it was actually intended as a source of comic relief.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Uniforms of the target regime frequently include peaked caps, [[jackboot]]s, and [[Sam Browne belt]]s, hinting at connections with [[Nazi Germany]] or the [[Warsaw Pact]].

In 2004, Professor [[Douglas Little]] of [[Clark University]] published a lengthy academic article explicitly linking the TV series to CIA history: "Mission Impossible: The CIA and the Cult of Covert Action in the Middle East".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adversaries unrelated to the Cold War ===
The IMF is also assigned to bring down politicians and dictators of [[Third World]] countries uninvolved in the Cold War. Practices such as [[slavery]], which was still legal in some nations in 1966 ("The Slave"&lt;!-- S2 E5 &amp; E6 --&gt;), and [[apartheid]] ("Kitara"&lt;!-- S5 E20 --&gt;), were targeted. The revival of the [[Nazi]] Party in Germany was targeted several times. Rollin Hand (played by [[Jewish]] actor [[Martin Landau]]) impersonated leading Nazi figures – [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Other themes included corrupt [[Central America|Central]] or [[South America]]n nations, as well as [[organized crime]] figures, corrupt businessmen, and politicians in the US.

This mirrors actual events of the era - see [[United States involvement in regime change#1960s|United States involvement in Regime Change]].

As noted in the reference work ''The Complete "Mission: Impossible" Dossier'' by Patrick J. White, many IMF missions were essentially assassinations in disguise. In the first-season episode "Memory",  the unspecified government agency behind the IMF has forbidden it to commit outright assassinations "as a matter of policy." To get around this restriction, many missions instead involve the IMF setting up its targets to be killed by their own people or other enemies. A notable example is the second-season, two-part story "The Council" later released to European movie houses under the title ''Mission Impossible vs. the Mob''.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 134}} This policy is not consistently followed; for example in "The Legend"&lt;!-- (S1 E20) --&gt;, Briggs' original plan is to personally shoot Nazi rallying-figure Martin Bormann, which is foiled by the discovery of a dummy and a tape recorder in the "man's" sick room. In other early-season episodes, for example "The Spy" &lt;!-- (S2 E16) --&gt; and the pilot episode, agents are shown shooting people when necessary (usually underlings or enemy soldiers). Overall, however, gunplay is relatively rare from the IMF, as its methods are more sophisticated and subtle, like those used by con men.

=== Fifth season ===
During the fifth season, with Paramount executives having gained greater control, new producer [[Bruce Lansbury]] began to phase out the international missions. These were more expensive to film, often requiring sets to be purpose-built, along with special costuming, etc., all of which was far less necessary for "domestic" settings. This would manifest itself the following year with the IMF battling organized crime in most episodes, though this season still featured more international forays than not. These gangland bosses are usually associated with a criminal organization called the "Syndicate", a generic organization, or its franchises. Generally when describing such assignments, the taped message notes that the target is outside the reach of "conventional law enforcement".

The objective of such missions is usually simply to obtain evidence that might be admissible in court, often taking the form of tricking the mobsters into making a confession while being recorded. Manipulating the targets into killing one another became much less frequent, as well. Lansbury also attempted to replace Peter Lupus, who was expressing dissatisfaction with his part at this time, with Sam Elliott. Over the course of the fifth season, Lupus's William "Willy" Armitage appeared in 13 of its 24 episodes, to the outrage of fans who demanded Armitage's return.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 281–84}}  By the end of the fifth season, Elliott was gone; he did appear in the first filmed episode of season six,{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 340–41}} and Lupus remained in the last two seasons, with Armitage being given a larger share of screen time and more demanding duties.

== Format ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
''Mission: Impossible'' is noted for its format, which rarely changed throughout the series. Indeed, the opening scenes acquired a ritualistic feel, befitting the "quasi-official" aura the program sought for the clandestine operations.

=== Title sequence ===
Each title sequence started with a fuse being lit. As the fuse burned across the screen, clips from scenes in the current episode were shown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/gallery/25-classic-tv-title-sequences/#mission-impossible-1966-73|title=25 Classic TV Title Sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by credits introducing the actors. Throughout the title sequence, only the show's theme music could be heard. In the fifth season, the series introduced an altered version of the theme, coinciding with episodes featuring Dr. Doug Robert during that season. Though Robert did not appear in subsequent seasons, altered versions of the theme were used. The opening title sequences were created for each episode by optical effects artist [[Howard A. Anderson, Jr.]]

=== Tape scene ===
Most episodes begin with the leader of the IMF getting the assignment from a hidden tape recorder and an envelope of photos and information that explains the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mjq.net/mitapes.htm|title=The Mission: Impossible Tape Scenes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tape almost always begins with "Good morning/afternoon/evening, Mr. Briggs/Phelps." (The only exception is the first-season episode "Action!", in which Briggs does not appear; Cinnamon Carter listens to the briefing). Then it explains the situation and ends with "Your mission Dan/Jim, should you decide to accept it" or words to that effect, with a brief explanation of the mission. The listener is reminded, "As always, should you or any of your IM Force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions."{{Sfn | Biederman | icu 2004 | p = 82}}  The instructions on the tape were read by voice actor [[Bob Johnson (actor)|Robert Cleveland "Bob" Johnson]]. At the end of the instructions, Phelps/Briggs is notified, "This tape will self-destruct in five [or, occasionally, "10"] seconds. Good luck, Dan/Jim." Then smoke would rise from the tape, and the instructions would be destroyed.  In some initial episodes, however, self-destructing tapes were created by adding a chemical to the tape and blowing air onto it, forcing the chemical to react by crumbling. This method was abandoned due to cost.{{Sfn | Biederman | 2004 | p = 85}} The word "self-destruct" was coined by the show's writers, but became widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=self-destruct|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|title=self-destruct|access-date=27 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few episodes, mostly in the first season, deviated from the use of photos and a self-destructing tape as the mission briefing. The very first episode (the series pilot) involved a phonograph record, which was delivered to Briggs in an airtight plastic envelope and which would "decompose one minute after the breaking of the seal" from exposure to air. A record used in another episode had to be played on a vintage phonograph, which had been rigged to scratch the record so badly as to render it unplayable once the briefing was complete. In a few instances, instructions at the end of the tape would ask Briggs/Phelps, "Please dispose of/destroy this recording in the usual manner/by the usual means." Briggs/Phelps would then throw it in an incinerator or use other means to destroy it.

A handful of exceptions to the taped messages from the IMF's controlling authority were used. Sometimes, circumstances more or less forced the team into action. This first occurred in the program's opening season, when a "syndicate" boss kidnaps and threatens to kill the teenaged daughter of a friend of Briggs unless he removes a grand-jury witness against the mobster from police protective custody. How this man knew Briggs was capable of such a task was not explained.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 78}} The last such instance was near the end of the series, when the survivors of a previous IMF operation (season six's "Casino") recognize a vacationing Phelps from security camera photos and kidnap him to force his team to retrieve evidence that a plea-bargaining mobster is about to turn over to authorities.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 409}}

In the fifth season, the producers experimented with the format by sometimes eliminating the taped briefing (and/or the team meeting in Phelps' apartment), starting the episode with the mission already underway. In a few other cases, a personal matter involving Briggs, Phelps or another IMF operative would result in an "off-book" mission being undertaken. After the first year, an entire season's worth of "tape scenes" were usually filmed all at once prior to production of the rest of the episodes, and the crew never knew which tape scene would appear with which episode until it was broadcast.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 12}}

Some tape scenes were reused, with only minor changes to various insert shots and Johnson's recorded voiceover. In the first season, for example, the same tape scene was used for both "Wheels" and "Legacy". The only differences were that the tape gave a different set of instructions in each episode, and a different set of insert shots of the photographs that Briggs is viewing is used. The cost-saving practice of recycling tape scenes continued throughout the series run; generally, each season reused at least one tape scene. One particular tape scene, of Phelps finding a tape in a parking lot attendant's hut, was actually used in three widely scattered episodes: "The Astrologer", "Recovery", and "The Vault".

=== Dossier scene ===
Next would follow what White refers to as the "Dossier Scene". Briggs or Phelps would be shown in a fancy apartment, retrieving an oversized, leather-bound folder from a locked drawer. Inside this folder were plastic-wrapped dossiers (usually featuring standard 8×10 "glossies" of the respective actors) of the available IMF agents. Briggs/Phelps would toss the selected agents' dossiers onto a table. According to White, most of the never-chosen dossiers were photographs of various series staffers and their wives, including  Bruce Geller and his wife.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 48}} A contemporary article in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{Issue| date= June 2009}} claimed that many of the photos put aside in the "dossier scene" were of studio and network executives and that it was considered a measure of one's status in the studio and network hierarchies to appear there, but White makes no such statement.

In early seasons, the agents selected often included guest stars playing agents with skills not possessed by the usual team. A doctor, particularly a specialist in a condition known to afflict the target, was a common sort of "guest agent". In numerous early episodes, the IMF leader would choose only two or three team members, though at least one of the main credited cast members was always involved. One episode, "Elena", featured a team consisting of Rollin Hand and Dr. Carlos Enero (guest star [[Barry Atwater]]);{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 79}} because of Landau's official status at that point as frequent guest star this meant that technically none of the series' regular players was involved. Almost as often, however, Briggs would choose all of the regulars, plus one, two, or even three others.

In later seasons, the team was much more stable, consisting of the regular cast for the season, and the use of guest agents became markedly less frequent. Numerous dossier scenes from the Peter Graves episodes feature Phelps poring through the photographs, only to once again choose the series regulars who had just been shown in the opening credits. By the third season, the dossier scene had been deemed somewhat disposable, appearing only when needed to introduce a guest agent. The first mission submitted by the Secretary that did not have the dossier scene was the last mission of the second season, "The Recovery". After a period of being seen only occasionally, the dossier scene was seen again frequently in season four, due to the lack of a regular female team member in that season. It was dropped entirely as of season five.

In the pilot episode, the recorded message states that the team leaders have unlimited resources and wide discretion in choosing their team. Who devises the plan is never made clear, although the team leader is often shown writing or making notes. Preparations and the necessary logistics were almost never shown, although they are generally implied by the scenes that depict various steps of the mission. Only a short period of time is implied to have elapsed from the initial assignment until the team is in the field. Early episodes occasionally showed more of the preliminaries. "Memory" features a montage of Dan Briggs training a guest agent to assume the role he will play in the mission. "Old Man Out, Part 1" includes a scene of Briggs approaching an operative (played by [[Mary Ann Mobley]]) to recruit her, meeting with resistance before he finally convinces her to join the mission.

=== Apartment scene ===
In the third segment of the opening act, called the "apartment scene" by White, the team would be shown convening for their final briefing in the leader's apartment. Although the series was shot in color, the apartment had a color scheme composed of black, white, and shades of gray, such that the apartment was sometimes referred to off-camera as the black-and-white room; Steven Hill once suggested that an American flag be placed on a wall of Briggs' apartment, but Bruce Geller vetoed it to maintain the color scheme.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 14}} Two exceptions are the first-season episodes, "Operation Rogosh", when the team immediately springs into action to capture their target in a staged auto accident, and "Action!", where the team meeting took place in another apartment.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 99}}

The apartment scene acted as a teaser. In discussing the plan and their roles in it, the team members would make vague references to preparations necessary for its successful execution, while leaving most details undisclosed. This scene also demonstrated and thereby established credibility for various gadgets or ploys that were key to the plan, such as a TV camera hidden in a brooch, a miniature radio-controlled hovercraft, a chess-playing computer, a "mentalist" or sleight-of-hand act, or a trained animal. In addition, this scene would establish, or at least hint at, the specialties and roles of any guest-star agents. Team members posing questions about aspects of the plan or why an alternative was not considered provided the writers with an opportunity to offer explanations for what otherwise might have seemed [[plot holes]].  When summing up, Phelps  often stressed the difficulties in the action they were about to undertake or some key element of the plan vital to its success, such as a deadline by which the mission had to be completed.

During the fifth season, the producers decided to drop the dossier scene and phase out the tape and apartment scenes. By the end of the season, however, it had been decided to keep the tape and apartment scenes, but the dossier-choosing scene was eliminated for the rest of the series run (this is White's version, but in fact episodes missing the tape and/or the meeting scenes were few). The 1980s revival reinstated the "dossier scene" in the first episode, when Phelps selects his new team, but since he keeps the same team in subsequent episodes, no subsequent dossier scenes were made.

=== Plan ===
[[File:Martin Landau-Mission-1968.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|[[Martin Landau]] in ''Mission: Impossible'' (1968)]]
The episode then depicted the plan being put into action. This almost always involved very elaborate deceptions, usually several at the same time.  Facilitating this, certain team members are masters of disguise, able to impersonate someone connected to the target or even the target himself. This is accomplished with realistic [[latex]] face masks and make-up. Some impersonations are done with the explicit cooperation of the one being impersonated. Also,'' bona fides'' would be arranged to aid infiltrating the target organization. In some cases, the actor playing the IMF agent also portrayed the person to be impersonated (this most frequently occurred during Martin Landau's tenure on the series, notably in the pilot) or the voice of the person being impersonated was dubbed. In other cases, a guest star would play the dual role of both the original and the imposter (Rollin, Paris, or Casey). Sometimes, one or more IMF team members allowed themselves to be captured to gain more access to or knowledge of the organization they are infiltrating, either by conversing with the target or being held in a jail cell and hatching their plan there.

A few episodes of the early seasons showed the painstaking creation and application of these masks, usually by disguise and make-up expert Rollin Hand. This was later omitted as the series progressed and the audience presumably became familiar with the mechanics of the team's methods. In the 1980s revival, the mask-making process involved a digital camera and computer and was mostly automatic. Most episodes included a dramatic "reveal" (also referred to as the "peel-off") near the end of the episode in which the team member would remove the mask.

Various other technological methods are commonly used, as well. The team would often reroute telephone or radio calls so these could be answered by their own members. Faked radio or television broadcasts are common, as are elevators placed under the team's control. In some missions, a very extensive simulated setting is created, such as a faked train or plane journey, submarine voyage, aftermath of a major disaster, or even the taking over of the United States by a foreign government. A particularly elaborate ploy, used on more than one occasion, has the IMF working to convince their target that several years had passed while the target was in a coma or suffering from amnesia. In one episode, the IMF even convinced their target (an aging mobster played by [[William Shatner]]) that time has somehow been turned back more than 30 years and he is a young man again.

The team usually arranged for some situation to arise with which the target would have to deal in a predictable way, and the team would then arrange the circumstances to guide the outcome to the desired end. Often, the plans turn on elaborate psychology, such as exploiting rivalries or an interest in the supernatural. Many plans simply cause the target to become confused or erratic or irrational, lose self-assurance, lose trust in subordinates or partners, etc., so that either the target would do what the team wanted (by falling back on predictable acts of desperation), or else the target's subordinates would replace the target and then act according to the team's predictions. These various ploys usually resulted in either information being revealed to the team, or the target's disgrace and discrediting, or both.

In many early episodes, the mission was to "neutralize" the target and the target is ultimately shot by his superiors, staff, or rivals, though this was usually not shown on screen.  In later seasons, where the targets were usually organized-crime figures or similar, the goal of the mission is often simply to collect incriminating evidence not obtainable by "conventional law-enforcement agencies". The team is not above falsifying such evidence as a last resort.

Dramatic tension was provided by situations in which team members appear to be in danger of being discovered (especially before commercial breaks). Sometimes, unexpected events occur that force the team to improvise. On occasion, an outside party or one of the targets realizes what is happening and puts the plan at risk.

[[William Read Woodfield]] and Allan Balter served as story consultants for the first two seasons. According to White,{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 163}} Woodfield and Balter relied heavily on ''The Big Con'', written by David W. Maurer, for their inspiration. Hence, Briggs/Phelps became the "grifter-in-charge", Rollin Hand and Cinnamon Carter were highly effective "ropers", and Barney Collier and Willy Armitage were experts at building or equipping "[[List of confidence tricks#Big Store|big stores]]". Woodfield and Balter later became producers of the third season. They did not last long and were dismissed for believing that executive producer Geller had no authority over them.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Filming locations ===
The original series was filmed almost exclusively around Hollywood and the [[Los Angeles Basin]]. The pilot episode was filmed at [[Mount St. Mary's University (Los Angeles)|Mount St. Mary's College]] (Brentwood Campus) with special guest star [[Wally Cox]].{{sfn | White | 1991 | p=44}} Other first season locations included the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] ([[Mission: Impossible (season 1)#ep4|"Old Man Out"]]){{sfn | White | 1991 | p=66}} and the Los Angeles [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific rail yard]] ([[Mission: Impossible (season 1)#ep24|"The Train"]]).{{sfn | White | 1991 | p=100}} [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and the [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] campus were common locations.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Another noted location was the [[Bradbury Building]], used in other films and series (from ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' to ''[[Blade Runner]]''). One episode ([[Mission: Impossible (season 2)#ep52|"Trial by Fury"]]) was filmed at the [[Stalag 13 (film set)|Stalag 13 set]] of ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]''.{{sfn | White | 1991 | p=153}}

=== Variations ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
Several times, the series deviated from the standard format. In one episode of the original series, a gangster kidnaps the daughter of a friend of Dan Briggs and forces him to abduct a witness against him. In another, a mistake causes Cinnamon Carter to be exposed and captured by the villains, and Jim Phelps has to prepare a plan to rescue her. Another episode featured Phelps on a personal mission, when he returns to his small hometown for a visit and finds a series of murders among his childhood acquaintances, with which the local law enforcement chief is unqualified to cope. In one episode, a friend of Jim Phelps is framed for murder, giving Phelps only 24 hours to find the real killer, prove his friend's innocence, and save his life. On two occasions, he is captured and the team has to rescue him. In "Cat's Paw", team members volunteer to go against the organization responsible for murdering Barney's brother. Willy is shot and captured in one episode, and captured and tortured by a drug kingpin in another. Paris is kidnapped and brainwashed in an attempt to get him to kill Phelps. Jim and Rollin are on a hunting trip when Jim is taken mysteriously ill. (It turns out the residents of a "[[Norman Rockwell]]" town are hired assassins, who attempt to poison Phelps when he stumbles on their secret.)

In the 1980s series, former IMF agent Barney Collier is framed for a crime he did not commit and the IMF team has to extricate him, leading to a reuniting of Barney with his son and IMF agent Grant Collier (played by real-life father and son Greg and Phil Morris).

=== Conclusion ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
In most cases, the action lasted right to the final seconds, with the episode ending in a [[Freeze frame television|freeze frame]] as the IMF team makes their escape, another successful mission concluded. Most often they leave in a nondescript panel truck. A dramatic device frequently used at the end was the sound of a gunshot or a scream in the distance as the target is killed by his associates, while the IMF team makes their getaway.  On one particular episode, the team escapes in a van after leaving a secret underground enemy base that is being destroyed by a series of explosions.  In the 1980s revival, this format was altered with the addition of a tag scene showing the IMF team regrouping (often still in disguise) and walking away. From the middle of the second season onwards, Jim Phelps often makes a quip.

== Music ==
Aside from the now iconic main theme, as well as the motif called "The Plot", which usually accompanied scenes of the team members carrying out the mission, the background music would incorporate minimalist innovations of percussion such as simply a snare drum and cymbals to build tension during the more "sneaky" moments of the episodes (sometimes accompanied by a bass flute playing). These quieter passages would greatly contrast the more bombastic fanfares when a mission member is at risk of getting caught just prior to a commercial break.

The [[Theme from Mission: Impossible|main theme]] was composed by Argentine composer, pianist, and conductor [[Lalo Schifrin]] and is noted for being in [[Quintuple meter|{{music|time|5|4}} time]]. About the unusual [[time signature]], Schifrin declared that "things are in {{music|time|2|4}} or {{music|time|4|4}} because people dance with two legs. I did it for people from outer space who have five legs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292863,00.html|title=They Shot, He Scored|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=June 7, 1996|first=Dave|last=Karger|access-date=2011-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Plot" was also composed by Schifrin, who scored three episodes in the first season and went on to score at least one or two episodes for most of the other seasons (season two is the only one to have no Schifrin-scored episodes, in part because he was helping to launch Geller's new series ''[[Mannix]]'').

Schifrin was awarded two [[Grammy]]s  at the [[10th Grammy Awards#Composing and arranging|10th Grammy Awards]] for his work on the first season (Best Instrumental Theme and Best Original Score for a Motion Picture or TV Show).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=Lalo+Schifrin&amp;title=&amp;year=1967&amp;genre=All 1967 Grammy Awards] accessed March 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was also nominated for two Emmys (for the first and third seasons). Among the other composers to work on the series were [[Jerry Fielding]], Walter Scharf, [[Gerald Fried]], Richard Markowitz, [[Benny Golson]], Robert Drasnin, and [[Hugo Montenegro]]. Gerald Fried worked on ''Mission: Impossible'' concurrently while working on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' television series and re-used the infamous "Star Trek fight music" in several ''Mission: Impossible'' episodes.

=== ''The Best of Mission: Impossible – Then and Now'' ===
Although two albums of re-recorded music from the original series had previously been released under Schifrin's name, ''[[Music from Mission: Impossible]]'' (Dot, 1967) and ''[[More Mission: Impossible]]'' (Paramount, 1968) the original scores were not commercially available until 1992 when [[GNP Crescendo]] released ''The Best of Mission: Impossible – Then and Now''&lt;ref&gt;{{MusicBrainz release|mbid=2b062d9d-dc45-38ab-93cc-70d4207167e3|name=The Best of Mission: Impossible: Then and Now}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring five scores by Lalo Schifrin for the original series and five by John E. Davis for the revival (Schifrin also scored three episodes of the revival, including the premiere, but none were included.)

{{main|Theme from Mission: Impossible}}
An [[electronic dance music|electronic dance]] version of the theme by [[U2]] bandmates [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] and [[Adam Clayton]] was released in 1996 to coincide with the release of the first ''Mission: Impossible'' movie. The single was a success, and it was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] (losing out to [[Béla Fleck and the Flecktones]]' "The Sinister Minister").

=== Edgar ===
* [[List of Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Episode in a TV Series winners|Best Episode in a TV series]] – Jerome Ross, for "Operation Rogosh", 1967

== Inspirations and innovations ==
A key inspiration for Geller in creating the series was the 1964 [[Jules Dassin]] film ''[[Topkapi (film)|Topkapi]]'', innovative for its coolly [[Existentialism|existential]] depiction of an elaborate heist. Geller switched the story away from the criminals of Topkapi to the good guys of the IMF, but kept Dassin's style of minimal dialogue, prominent music scoring and clockwork-precision plots executed by a team of diverse specialists. Several episodes in fact show close-up shots of an agent's wristwatch to convey the suspense of working on a deadline.

One of the more controversial points of Geller's was his insistence on minimizing character development. This was done intentionally both because he felt that seeing the characters as ''[[tabula rasa|tabulae rasae]]'' would make them more convincing in undercover work, and because he wanted to keep the focus on the caper and off the characters themselves. Geller would even veto the writers' attempts to develop the characters in the episodes. This is why, even after Geller was removed from the show, the IMF agents would only have one scene at Jim's apartment where they interacted, and they were rarely if ever seen in their "real" lives.

As a side effect of this, cast turnover was never once explained on the show. None of the main characters ever died or were disavowed in the original series, but a character could disappear between episodes without mention or acknowledgment. The 1980s revival, however, did kill off a main character on screen. Mimi Davis is the only character whose recruitment as an IMF agent was shown on screen, although such a scene was filmed for Dana Lambert ([[Lesley Ann Warren]]) and discarded.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 294}}  The 1980s revival otherwise stayed true to Geller's edict, with the occasional brief exception.

The producers of ''Mission: Impossible'' were sued for plagiarism by the creators of an ABC show called ''[[21 Beacon Street]].'' The suit was settled out of court. Geller claimed never to have seen the earlier show; ''Beacon Street's'' story editor and pilot scripter, Laurence Heath, would later write several episodes of ''Mission: Impossible.''{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 8–9}}

Writer [[William Read Woodfield]] was a fan of David Maurer's nonfiction book about con artists, ''The Big Con'' (also an unofficial inspiration for ''[[The Sting]]''), and many episodes are strikingly similar to cons described in the book.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 17}}

The tape scene is very similar to one described in the 1964 [[Nick Carter-Killmaster]] novel ''[[Saigon (Killmaster novel)|Saigon]]'', published in December 1964 and repeated in the 1966 novel ''[[Danger Key]]'' (copyright registered in February 1966). In the novels, secret agent Carter receives a package from his boss which, when activated, plays a tape-recorded message that self-destructs after playing once.

Part of each episode's [[title sequence]] was highly unusual, as it was composed of a number of very short clips of key scenes from the subject episode. This was, and remains, very rare for series television. However, it was already being done as of the previous season on ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', which like ''Mission'' had the lighting of a fuse leading to it. The hand with the match was, until sometime in the sixth season, that of creator Bruce Geller; in the [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|revival series]], the hand belonged to Peter Graves, who was shown holding the match. Several British teleseries produced by [[Gerry Anderson]] and his then wife [[Sylvia Anderson]], the contemporaneous ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'' (made in 1964) and the mid-1970s ''[[Space: 1999]]'' (which starred ''Mission: Impossible'' alumni Martin Landau and Barbara Bain) amongst them, also showed clips in the opening sequence. The reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' TV series also used this device. The clips in the opening sequence were chosen to showcase dramatic moments in the upcoming mission, such as moments of surprise, moments of violence, or equipment in use. In particular, the first clip shown was often someone getting punched and/or knocked out. For the first two seasons, the closing credits showed clips from that mission in freeze frame. At the start of 1968, when Paramount took over from Desilu, the same clips were shown during the closing credits across episodes; later seasons eschewed that approach, featuring a freeze frame of the hand lighting the fuse.

''Mission: Impossible'' is still recognized for its innovative use of music. Composer [[Lalo Schifrin]] wrote several distinctive pieces for the series. The visual cuts in the main [[title sequence]] were timed to the beats and measures of the [[theme music|theme tune]]—written in (unusual) [[Unusual time signatures|{{music|time|5|4}} time]]—while an animated burning fuse moved across the screen.  Most episodes included fairly long dialogue-free sequences showing the team members—particularly electronics expert Barney Collier—making technical preparations for the mission, usually to the accompaniment of another easily recognizable tune called "The Plot." Lalo Schifrin also wrote a theme piece for each main character and the sound track for each episode incorporated variations of these throughout. Even when an episode's score is credited to some other composer, Desilu's music supervisor Jack Hunsacker would re-edit it, adding Schifrin melodies from the library.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | p = 50}}  The series had great impact on film and TV music. Before ''Mission: Impossible,'' a common compliment was along the lines of "the score worked very well but never got in the way or called attention to itself."  By contrast, ''Mission: Impossible'' was praised for the prominence of its music.

At 171 episodes, the original version of ''Mission: Impossible'' held the record for having the most episodes of any English-language espionage television series for over 35 years (about 10 more episodes than its nearest rival, the UK-produced ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]).''  Its record was broken during the eighth season of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' in 2010.{{citation needed | date =December 2011}}

[[Rerun]]s of ''Mission: Impossible'' are still shown weekly on [[Me-TV]] affiliate TV stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metvnetwork.com/shows/mission-impossible|title=MeTV Network – Shows}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original series' seven seasons are available online at the [[CBS]] All Access mobile, tablet and Roku applications.

The secret message tape scene has been parodied in other shows.  One example is in the animated TV series ''[[The Houndcats]]'' where after the Chief gives the Houndcats their instructions he warns them that the "message will self-destruct in five seconds" at which point the team panics as it then desperately tries to get rid of the message before it explodes.

== Franchise successors ==
{{Main|Mission: Impossible (franchise)}}

=== Television revival ===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)}}
In 1980, media reports indicated that a reunion of the original cast was in the planning stages, for a project to be called ''Mission: Impossible 1980''. Ultimately this project was delayed into 1983 (with the working title suitably updated repeatedly) before being canceled altogether due to one plot after another being deemed inappropriate and unacceptable.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 429–31}} In 1984, another proposed ''Mission: Impossible'' reunion was to have been a theatrical film, titled ''Good Morning, Mr. Phelps (Mission: Impossible – The Movie)''. Ultimately, the proposed large budget sank this project.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 431–32}}

In 1988, the American fall television season was hampered by a [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|writers' strike]] that prevented the commissioning of new scripts. Producers, anxious to provide new product for viewers but with the prospect of a lengthy strike, went into the vaults for previously written material. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', for example, used scripts written for [[Star Trek: Phase II|an aborted ''Star Trek'' revival series]] proposed during the 1970s. The [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network decided to launch a new ''Mission: Impossible'' series, with a mostly new cast (except for Peter Graves, who returned as Phelps), but using scripts from the original series, suitably updated. To save even more on production costs, the series was filmed in Australia; the first season in Queensland, and the second in [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]]. Costs were, at that time, some 20 percent lower in Australia than in [[Hollywood]]. The new ''Mission: Impossible'' was one of the first American commercial network programs to be filmed in Australia.

According to Patrick White's book, the original plan was for the series to be an actual remake of the original series, with the new cast playing the same characters from the original series: Rollin Hand, Cinnamon Carter, et al. Just before filming began, White writes, the decision was made to rework the characters so that they were now original creations, albeit still patterned after the originals, with only Jim Phelps remaining unchanged.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 433–34}}

The new series was not a hit, but it was produced cheaply enough to keep it on the ABC schedule. The new ''Mission: Impossible'' ultimately lasted for two years; the writers' strike was resolved quickly enough that only four episodes were actual remakes, which, along with the decision to change the character names and backgrounds, resulted in the series being considered a continuation of the original series, rather than simply a remake.

The original series formula described above was largely repeated in the second ''Mission: Impossible'' series of the 1980s, though the writers took some liberties and tried to stretch the rules somewhat. Most notably, by the time of the revival series, the Impossible Mission Force was no longer a small, clandestine operation, but larger in scale, with references now made to IMF divisions and additional teams similar to the one run by Phelps. One episode of the later series featured the only occasion in which a regular IMF agent was killed on a mission and subsequently disavowed. The 1980s series also had IMF agents using technology that nearly pushed the series into the realm of [[science fiction]], such as one gadget that could record dreams, and another that allowed the IMF to change the surfaces (actually digital screens) of special playing cards to appear to be whatever cards the plan required.

The revived series included special appearances by several 1960s–70s IMF veterans, including Lynda Day George, and [[Greg Morris]] as Barney; Morris's son, [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]], played Barney's son in the new series. Four guest stars from the original run all played targets here, [[Alex Cord]], [[James Shigeta]], and in the same episode, [[Barbara Luna]] and Australian [[Michael Pate]].

=== Feature films ===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible (film series)}}

In the early 1970s the second season two-part story ''The Council'' was distributed to European movie houses, theatres and cinemas as a full-length feature film titled ''[[Mission: Impossible vs. the Mob]]''.

A feature film based upon the series was first proposed in 1978, then to be made for TV. This was the first of several attempts through the 1980s, but no feature production materialized.{{Sfn | White | 1991 | pp = 429–33}}

Later, six feature films were released, produced by and starring [[Tom Cruise]]:
* ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' (1996)
* ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'' (2000)
* ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' (2006)
* ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'' (2011)
* ''[[Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation]]'' (2015)
* ''[[Mission: Impossible – Fallout]]'' (2018)

IMF leader Jim Phelps, played by [[Peter Graves]] in the original series, has a supporting role in the first of these films, and is played by [[Jon Voight]]; none of the other films feature any characters from the television series. 

In the early 2000s, ''Mission: Impossible'' was the only successful franchise of [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly A. Owczarski: ''“More Than Meets the Eye”: Transformers and the Complexities of Franchise Film Production in Contemporary Hollywood'', in: [[Quarterly Review of Film and Video]], Vol. 32 (2015), No. 8, pp. 675–694 (here: p. 684).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
* 1990: ''[[Mission: Impossible (1990 video game)|Mission: Impossible]]''. Published by [[Konami]] under its [[Ultra Games]] label for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]. The game is based on [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|the 1988–1990 TV series]].
* 1998: ''[[Mission: Impossible (1998 video game)|Mission: Impossible]]''. Published by [[Infogrames Entertainment]] for the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. The plot is loosely based on [[Mission: Impossible (film)|the 1996 film]].
* 2000: ''[[Mission: Impossible (2000 video game)|Mission: Impossible]]''. Published by Infogrames Entertainment for the [[Game Boy Color]]. This version is a loose adaptation of the 1998 game.
* 2003: ''[[Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma]]''. Published by [[Atari]] for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], and [[Game Boy Advance]]. The game features an original story with characters from the film series, with [[Ving Rhames]] reprising his role as computer expert [[Luther Stickell]].
* 2011: ''Mission: Impossible – The Game''. Paramount Pictures and [[Funtactix]] [[Social-network game|social game]] for [[Facebook]], based on the first three ''Mission: Impossible'' films, with a later extension based on the fourth, release to promote the film ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Gamer live | url = http://www.gamerlive.tv/article/mission-impossible-invades-facebook-new-ghost-protocol-game-tie | title = Mission: Impossible Invades Facebook with New Ghost Protocol Game Tie-In}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, game designer [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] released ''Mission: Impossible'', a [[text adventure]] game that placed the player in the role of a secret agent trying to save the world. Adams had failed to acquire the rights to the title, and the game was quickly reissued as ''Impossible Mission'' and later ''Secret Mission''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = If legends | url = http://www.if-legends.org/~aimemorial/secret.html | title = Adventure International | contribution = Secret Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the title and the name "Mr. Phelps" being mentioned on the tape recording at the beginning of the game, it had no overt connection to the TV series.

The 1984 computer game ''[[Impossible Mission]]'' also featured a story in which the player takes the role of a secret agent who must stop an evil genius, but it also has no overt connection to the ''Mission: Impossible'' franchise, although the game's designer Dennis Caswell claimed that the title was chosen because "it was, at least, somewhat descriptive, and the obvious allusion to ''Mission: Impossible'' was expedient."&lt;ref name="Retro122"&gt;{{cite news | last = Bevan | first= Mike | date = December 2013 | title = The History of... Impossible Mission | work = [[Retro Gamer]] | issue = 122 | pages = 44–49 | publisher = [[Imagine Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print ===
Four original ''Mission: Impossible'' novels based upon the series were published in paperback by
[[Popular Library]] between 1967 and 1969:

# ''Mission: Impossible'' by [[Walter Wager]] as "John Tiger" * (1967)
# ''Mission: Impossible #2: Code Name: Judas'' by Jim Lawrence as "Max Walker" * (1968) 
# ''Mission: Impossible #3: Code Name: Rapier'' by Jim Lawrence as "Max Walker" (1968)
# ''Mission: Impossible #4: Code Name: Little Ivan'' by [[Walter Wager]] as "John Tiger" (1969)
* Whereas "John Tiger" was a pseudonym Walter Wager devised for himself (initially for what would become a series of seven original novels based on [[I Spy (1965 TV series)|''I Spy'' [1965 TV series]]], also published by Popular Library), the Walker by-line was, very briefly, a Popular Library "house" pseudonym, used only for the two M:I novels by Lawrence and subsequently for [[Michael Avallone]]'s novelization of [[The Last Escape (1970 film)|''The Last Escape'' (1970 film)]].

In addition, two hardback novels for young readers were published by Whitman Books, both by [[:fr:Talmage Powell|Talmage Powell]]:

# ''Mission: Impossible: The Priceless Particle'' (1969)
# ''Mission: Impossible: The Money Explosion'' (1970)

Of the above, only the 1967 "John Tiger" novel featured the team as led by Dan Briggs; the rest all featured the Jim Phelps-era IMF.

[[Dell Comics]] published a ''Mission: Impossible'' [[comic book]] on a sporadic schedule that lasted from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s. Only five issues were published before the series was canceled. The first four issues were original publications; the fifth issue was a reprint of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=5177|title=Mission: Impossible (1967) – Comic Book DB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, [[Marvel Comics]] published a single-issue ''Mission: Impossible'' comic which served as a [[prequel]] to the 1996 feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbookdb.com/title.php?ID=5178|title=Mission Impossible (1996) – Comic Book DB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the GAF Corporation of Portland, Oregon/Paramount Films released a [[View-Master]] (21 stereo pictures in three round discs) with a 16-page story booklet: "Good morning Mr Phelps. The man you are looking at is Dr. Erich Rojak, the nuclear physicist who has been missing..."{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

But I am not proud of it either — I don't think it's cool, like I was Mr. Rock ’n’ Roll, blackout and all that shit. It wasn't, it was just terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Tim|last=Jonze|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/09/simon-pegg-alcoholic-addiction-rehab-fatherhood-tom-cruise|title=Simon Pegg on Battling Alcoholism, Depression: "It Owned Me"|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-GB|date=9 July 2018|access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pegg checked into a [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] shortly before production of ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]''. Hiding his recovery from the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] through court orders, some journalists went so far as to call the clinic pretending to be Pegg's mother. Pegg attended [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings and has remained sober since.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/09/simon-pegg-alcoholic-addiction-rehab-fatherhood-tom-cruise&lt;/ref&gt;

The town near the foot of the lake is named [[Wanaka]]. A [[Kāti Māmoe]] settlement at the site of the modern township was ''Para karehu''.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

==Geography==

===Geography===
Lake Wānaka lies at the heart of the Otago Lakes in the lower South Island of New Zealand. The township of Wanaka, which sits in a glacier-carved basin on the shores of the lake, is the gateway to [[Mount Aspiring National Park|Mt Aspiring National Park]]. [[Lake Hāwea]] is a 15-minute drive away, en route to the frontier town of [[Makarora]], the last stop before the West Coast Glacier region. To the south is the historic [[Cardrona Valley]], a popular scenic alpine route to neighbouring [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]].

===Geology===
At its greatest extent, which is roughly along a north–south axis, the lake is 42 kilometres long. Its widest point, at the southern end, is 10 kilometres. The lake's western shore is lined with high peaks rising to over 2000 metres above sea level. Along the eastern shore the land is also mountainous, but the peaks are somewhat lower.

Lake Wānaka lies in a [[u-shaped valley]] formed by [[glacier|glacial]] erosion during the last [[ice age]], more than 10,000 years ago. It is fed by the [[Matukituki River|Matukituki]] and [[Makarora River]]s, and is the source of the [[Clutha River / Mata-Au]]. Nearby [[Lake Hāwea]] lies in a parallel valley carved by a neighbouring glacier eight kilometres to the east. At their closest point (a rocky ridge called The Neck), the lakes are only 1,000 metres apart.&lt;ref name="T2"&gt;[http://www.newzealand.com/travel/sights-activities/scenic-highlights/lakes/sh-lake-wanaka-and-hawea.cfm Lakes: Laka Wanaka and Hawea] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/676ClFFma?url=http://www.newzealand.com/int/article/lakes-wanaka-and-hawea/ |date=21 April 2012 }} (from the [[Tourism New Zealand]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;

Small islands towards the foot of the lake include Ruby Island, [[Stevensons Island]] and Harwich Island. Some host ecological sanctuaries, such as one for [[weka|buff weka]] on Stevensons Island.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_710786"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411879/710786 |title=What's Up DOC – Wanaka |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The towns of [[Wanaka]] and [[Albert Town, New Zealand|Albert Town]] are near the lake's outflow into the Clutha / Mata-Au.

==Human history==

===Exploration and settlement===

For [[Māori people|Māori]], the Wānaka area was a natural crossroads. The [[Haast Pass]] gave access to the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] and its [[pounamu]]; the Cardrona Valley led to the natural rock bridge "Whatatorere", which was the only place that the [[Kawarau River]] and [[Clutha River / Mata-Au]] could be crossed without boats.&lt;ref name="DoC"&gt;{{cite book

The Cromwell basin supported a large population of [[moa]], which were hunted to extinction about 500 years ago.&lt;ref name="DoC"/&gt;

Until the early nineteenth century, Wānaka was visited annually by [[Ngāi Tahu]] who sought [[pounamu]] in the mountains above the [[Haast River]] and hunted eels and birds over summer, returning to the east coast by descending the Clutha River / Mata-Au in ''mōkihi'' reed boats.&lt;ref name=TeAraOtagoMaori/&gt;

According to the Ngāi Tahu, Lake Wānaka was dug by the [[Waitaha (South Island iwi)|Waitaha]] explorer Rākaihautū with his [[Foot plough|kō]] named Tūwhakaroria. After Waitaha arrived in the Uruao waka at Whakatū ([[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]]), Rākaihautū divided his people into two groups. Rākaihautū led his group down the middle of the island, digging the freshwater lakes of [[Te Waipounamu]].&lt;ref name="nront"/&gt;

Numerous ''kāinga mahinga kai'' (food-gathering places) and ''kāinga nohoanga'' (settlements) were located around the lake. The [[Kāti Māmoe]] settlement at the site of modern Wanaka was named ''Para karehu''.  The area was invaded by the Ngāi Tahu in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;

Ngāi Tahu use of the land was ended by [[History of the Otago Region#Ngati Toa invasions|attacks by North Island tribes]].&lt;ref name="DoC"/&gt; In the last years of the [[Musket Wars]], in 1836 the [[Ngati Tama]] chief [[Te Puoho-o-te-rangi|Te Puoho]] led a 100-person war party, armed with muskets, down the West Coast and over the Haast Pass: they fell on the Ngāi Tahu encampment between Lake Wānaka and [[Lake Hāwea]], capturing 10 people and killing and eating two children.&lt;ref name=Smith1910&gt;{{cite book

The first known map of Lake Wānaka was drawn in 1844 by the southern Ngāi Tahu leader Te Huruhuru.&lt;ref name="nront"/&gt; The first European to see the lake was [[Nathanael Chalmers|Nathaniel Chalmers]] in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Jock Phillips

&lt;/ref&gt; Guided by Reko and Kaikoura, he walked from Tuturau ([[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]]) to the lake via the [[Kawarau River]]. However he was stricken by dysentery, so his guides returned him down the Clutha, shooting the rapids in a ''mōkihi'' reed boat.&lt;ref name="TeAraNC"&gt;

By 1861, several sheep stations had been established in and around the south end of the lake, and in 1862, the lake itself was surveyed in a whaleboat.&lt;ref name="TEARA"/&gt; The early European name was Lake Pembroke.&lt;ref&gt;

===Current use and tourism===
[[File:Lake Wanaka.jpg|thumb|244px|right|Lake Wānaka on an overcast day.]]

In addition to ongoing sheep farming, the lake is now a popular resort, and is much used in the summer for fishing, boating and swimming. The nearby mountains and fast-flowing rivers allow for [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]] year-round, with [[jetboat]]ing and [[skiing]] facilities located nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/|title=Wanaka Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] airport close by, tourism mirrors that of the surrounding areas.

===Conservation===
As one of the few lakes in the South Island with an unmodified shoreline, the lake is protected by special legislation, the Lake Wanaka Preservation Act of 1973. The Act established a 'Guardians of Lake Wanaka' group, appointed by the Minister of Conservation, which advises on measures to protect the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.govt.nz/about-doc/role/corporate-publications/briefings-to-new-ministers-archive/briefing-to-the-incoming-minister-of-conservation-2011/6-institutional-arrangements/6_1-statutory-bodies/ Briefing to the incoming Minister of Conservation 2011 – containing information about Statutory bodies, including the Guardians] (from the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] website, Friday 14 December 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygen weed (''[[Lagarosiphon major]]''), an aquarium plant and [[invasive species]] native to Southern Africa, has been a problem in the lake's ecosystem for some time. Attempts to eradicate the weed have not been successful. Substantial [[dredging|suction dredging]] operations have shown promise, but tend to miss isolated spots which then regrow into larger weed beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.linz.govt.nz/docs/crownproperty/biosecurity/lake-wanaka-assessment-2006.pdf |title= Assessment of the 2005/06 ''Lagarosiphon major'' programme in Lake Wanaka |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090920235224/http://www.linz.govt.nz/docs/crownproperty/biosecurity/lake-wanaka-assessment-2006.pdf |archivedate= 20 September 2009 }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(1.20&amp;nbsp;[[Mebibyte|MiB]])}} ([[National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research|NIWA]] report, June 2006, from the [[Land Information New Zealand]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;

"That Wanaka Tree" – a [[willow]] growing just inside the lake – is a tourist attraction in its own right, featuring on many tourists' [[Instagram]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Mission: Impossible 2''''' (stylized as '''''M:i-2''''')&lt;ref name="bfi"/&gt; is a 2000 [[action film|action]] [[spy film]] directed by [[John Woo]] and produced by and starring [[Tom Cruise]]. The sequel to 1996 film ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'', it is the second installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. It follows [[Ethan Hunt]] as he is tasked by the [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) to find and destroy a dangerous [[biological weapon]] called "Chimera" from rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose with the help of love interest Nyah Nordoff-Hall, Ambrose's ex-girlfriend.

''Mission: Impossible 2'' was released in theaters worldwide on May 24, 2000 to strong box office results, and grossed over $546 million worldwide, becoming the [[2000 in film#Highest grossing films|highest-grossing film of 2000]], and was the highest-grossing film in the series for 11 years. The film was followed by ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]'' in 2006.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] for [[Ethan Hunt]], an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the [[Chimera (virus)|Chimera]] virus, and its cure, [[Bellerophon]]. With Ethan on vacation and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.

IMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in [[Seville]], [[Spain]]. Nyah was recruited as a part of the team to trace Ambrose and his team since she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. Ethan reluctantly convinces her to [[spy]] on Ambrose.

Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. At a [[horse racing]] event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's [[CEO]], John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before [[blackmail]]ing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's [[red blood cell]]s. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.

Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.

Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a [[pandemic]]. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose's men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.

IMF clears Nyah's criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.

==Production==
According to screenwriter [[Robert Towne]] several action sequences were already planned for the film prior to his involvement and before the story had been written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/its-just-as-hard-every-time-robert-towne-on-screenwriting/|title="It's just as hard every time." Robert Towne on Screenwriting|last=Argent|first=Daniel|date=February 25, 2016|publisher=Creative Screenwriting|access-date=February 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio expressed concern over the safety of shooting Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)'s entrance in the film, where he is [[free solo climbing]] in [[Moab, Utah]]'s [[Dead Horse Point State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovermoab.com/movie.htm|title=Moab Movie Locations - Take a tour of some of Moab's famous movie locations.|access-date=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise refused to drop the idea because he could not think of a better way to reintroduce the character. There was no safety net as he filmed the sequence, but he did have a [[Climbing harness|harness]]. He tore his shoulder when performing the jump from one part of the cliff to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross: Series 16: Episode 1|publisher=[[BBC iPlayer]]|date=January 23, 2009 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00fm6wz/Friday_Night_with_Jonathan_Ross_Series_16_Episode_1/ | access-date=January 24, 2009}}{{expired link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the scenes were also shot in Sydney, Australia.

In a 2020 interview, Thandie Newton spoke about her tense on-set experiences with Cruise when filming the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/thandie-newton-tom-cruise-fight-mission-impossible-set-1234571694title=Thandie Newton Shares Her ‘Nightmare’ Tom Cruise Story from ‘Mission: Impossible 2’|publisher=Indiewire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://people.com/movies/thandie-newton-recalls-nightmare-with-tom-cruise-on-mission-impossible-2-set-he-was-really-stressed/|title=Thandie Newton Recalls 'Nightmare' Scene with Tom Cruise on M:I 2 Set: 'He Was Really Stressed'|publisher= People}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/thandie-newton-in-conversation.html|title=In Conversation: Thandie Newton|publisher=Vulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said that "if the first movie was entertaining as sound, fury, and movement, this one is more evolved, more confident, more sure-footed in the way it marries minimal character development to seamless action."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mission-impossible-ii-2000|title=Mission: Impossible II|author=Roger Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=May 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' felt the film was a "throwaway pleasure" but also "a triumph of souped-up action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276298,00.html "Mission: Impossible 2 (2000)"], [[Owen Gleiberman]], June 2, 2000, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Time Inc.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ella Taylor of ''[[LA Weekly]]'' said that "every car chase, every plane crash, every potential drop off a cliff is a masterpiece of grace and surprise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/film/film_results.php3?showid=1169 Mission: Impossible II review], Ella Taylor, ''[[LA Weekly]]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115195615/http://www.laweekly.com/film/film_results.php3?showid=1169 |date=January 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Desson Howe of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that "[John] Woo [...] takes complete command of the latest technology to create brilliant action sequences."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite news --&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/entertainment/movies/reviews/missionimpossible2howe.htm "'M:I-2': Mission Accomplished"], Desson Howe, May 26, 2000, ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' said, "Check your brains at the popcorn stand and hang on for a spectacular ride."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/movies/4523.htm Mission: Impossible II review], Lou Lumenick, ''[[New York Post]]''. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010613060620/http://www.nypost.com/movies/4523.htm |date=June 13, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Hoberman of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called the film "a vaguely absurd thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale James Bond riffs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/issues/0022/hoberman.shtml "Smoke and Mirrors"], J. Hoberman, May 30, 2000, ''[[The Village Voice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film is "even more empty a luxury vehicle than its predecessor" and that it "pushes the envelope in terms of just how much flashy packaging an audience will buy when there's absolutely nada inside."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117782016/ "Mission: Impossible 2"], Dennis Harvey, May 23, 2000, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Rosenbaum of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' said that "no hero or villain winds up carrying any moral weight at all."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/mission-impossible-2/Film?oid=1048866 Mission: Impossible II review], Jonathan Rosenbaum, ''[[Chicago Reader]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a retrospective commentary in 2012, Brad Brevet noted the film has significant similarities in plot and themes to [[Alfred Hitchcock|Alfred Hitchcock's]] 1946 film ''[[Notorious (1946 film)|Notorious]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ropeofsilicon.com/did-you-know-mission-impossible-2-is-a-remake-of-hitchcocks-notorious-here-have-a-look/|title=Did You Know 'Mission: Impossible 2' is a Remake of Hitchcock's 'Notorious'?

'''''Mission: Impossible''''' is a 1996 American [[action film|action]] [[spy film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Foutch |first1=Haleigh |title='Mission: Impossible' 20 Years Later: How An Uneasy Spy Thriller Became a Blockbuster Franchise |url=http://collider.com/mission-impossible-tom-cruise-20-years-later/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=May 22, 2016 |access-date=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Brian De Palma]] and produced by and starring [[Tom Cruise]]. A continuation of both [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|the original television series of the same name]] and its [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|revived sequel series]] (and set six years after the events of the latter show), it is the first installment in the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. The plot follows [[Ethan Hunt]] (Cruise) and his mission to uncover the mole who has framed him for the murders of most of his [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) team.

Work on the script had begun early with filmmaker [[Sydney Pollack]] on board, before De Palma, [[Steven Zaillian]], [[David Koepp]], and [[Robert Towne]] were brought in. ''Mission: Impossible'' went into pre-production without a shooting script: De Palma devised several action sequences, but Koepp and Towne were dissatisfied with the story that led up to those events. [[U2]] band members [[Larry Mullen Jr.]] and [[Adam Clayton]] produced a [[electronic dance music|dance]] rendition of the [[Theme from Mission: Impossible|original theme music]], which became a top-ten hit in the US (receiving gold record certification) and six other countries and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]].

''Mission: Impossible'' was a commercial success, eventually becoming the [[1996 in film|third highest-grossing film of 1996]] along with a mostly positive response from critics. Its success spawned the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
[[Jim Phelps]] and his latest [[Impossible Missions Force]] (IMF) team, who had just finished a mission in [[Kyiv]], are dispatched to stop the theft of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[non-official cover]] (NOC) list from the American embassy in [[Prague]] by rogue agent Alexander Golitsyn. However, the mission unexpectedly fails: the list is stolen, Phelps is shot, his wife Claire and another agent die in a car bombing, and the rest of the team, including Golitsyn, are eliminated by unknown assassins and supposed tech malfunctions, with [[Ethan Hunt]] being the sole survivor. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy, and the mission was a setup to lure out a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as "Max" as part of "Job 314." As Hunt is the only surviving member, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees, using explosive chewing gum given to him by a fellow agent before the mission started to cover his escape.

Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes "Job 314" refers to Bible verse [[Book of Job|Job]] 3:14, "Job" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining that she escaped the car bombing after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that she has been given a fake list on a disc equipped with a tracking device. Max and her agents escape, taking Hunt with them, just before a CIA team raids their location; Hunt promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Claire chooses to join Ethan, despite his initial protests against it, stating that since she is alive, the IMF will consider her a co-conspirator to Ethan whether she goes with him or not.

Hunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert [[Luther Stickell]] and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]] in [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]], steal the real list while narrowly avoiding detection, and flee to [[London]]. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street Station]]. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having found a Bible with a [[Gideons International|Gideons]] stamp that Phelps stole from [[Chicago]]'s [[Drake Hotel (Chicago)|Drake Hotel]] during a previous assignment known to Hunt's team. Hunt pieces together how Phelps betrayed the team: he programmed the elevator to kill the technician, faked being shot, and had the car rigged to explode. Hunt also suspects Krieger in the deaths of the other IMF members, including Golitsyn, in Prague, having recognized his distinctive knife; however, he is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the [[TGV]] train to Paris the next day and secretly sends tickets to Kittridge.

On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and directs Hunt to the baggage car, where he can find both the money and Job. Hunt calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Hunt will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Hunt, since they will need a fall guy, but Phelps reveals himself to be Hunt in a mask, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps' image to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole.

Phelps threatens to kill Hunt, but kills Claire instead when she tries to talk him out of it. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Angry over Claire's murder, Hunt chases after him. As Jim attempts to escape, Hunt launches himself towards Jim. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the [[Channel Tunnel]] after the train. Hunt attaches explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps, while himself jumping to safety. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents. Hunt is unsure about returning to the team, but on the flight home, an attendant uses a coded phrase to ask him if he is ready to take on a new mission.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
[[Paramount Pictures]] owned the rights to the television series and had tried for years to make a film version but had failed to come up with a viable treatment. [[Tom Cruise]] had been a fan of the show since he was young and thought that it would be a good idea for a film.&lt;ref name="Portman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Portman |first= Jamie |title= Cruise's Mission Accomplished |work= [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location= Montreal |page = E3 | date= May 18, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor chose ''Mission: Impossible'' to be the inaugural project of his new [[Cruise/Wagner Productions|production company]] and convinced Paramount to put up a $70 million budget.&lt;ref name="Penfield"&gt;{{cite news | last= Penfield III | first =Wilder |title=The Impossible Dream |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |page = S3 |date= May 19, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise and his producing partner, [[Paula Wagner]], worked on a story with filmmaker [[Sydney Pollack]] for a few months when the actor hired [[Brian De Palma]] to direct.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite news |last= Green | first= Tom | title= Handling an impossible task A 'Mission' complete with intrigue | work = [[USA Today]] |page =1D | date= May 22, 1996 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16346882.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went through two screenplay drafts that no one liked. De Palma brought in screenwriters [[Steve Zaillian]], [[David Koepp]], and finally [[Robert Towne]]. When the film was green-lit Koepp was initially fired with Robert Towne being the lead writer and Koepp being brought back on later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people= [[Noah Baumbach|Baumbach, Noah]]; [[Jake Paltrow]] |publisher=[[A24 (company)|A24]] | title=[[De Palma (film)|De Palma]] |medium=Motion picture |date=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the director, the goal of the script was to "constantly surprise the audience."&lt;ref name = "Green" /&gt; Reportedly, Koepp was paid $1 million to rewrite an original script by [[Willard Huyck]] and [[Gloria Katz]]. According to one project source, there were problems with dialogue and story development. However, the basic plot remained intact.&lt;ref name = "Brennan"&gt;{{cite news |last= Brennan |first= Judy |title=Cruise's ''Mission'' |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=December 16, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film went into pre-production without a script that the filmmakers wanted to use.&lt;ref name = "Green" /&gt; De Palma designed the action sequences but neither Koepp nor Towne were satisfied with the story that would make these sequences take place. Towne ended up helping organize a beginning, middle and end to hang story details on while De Palma and Koepp worked on the plot.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; De Palma convinced Cruise to set the first act of the film in Prague, a city rarely seen in Hollywood films at the time.&lt;ref name = "Penfield" /&gt; Reportedly, studio executives wanted to keep the film's budget in the $40–50 million range, but Cruise wanted a "big, showy action piece" that took the budget up to the $62 million range.&lt;ref name="Brennan" /&gt; The scene that takes place in a glass-walled restaurant with a big lobster tank in the middle and three huge fish tanks overhead was Cruise's idea.&lt;ref name = "Penfield" /&gt; There were 16 tons in all of the tanks and there was a concern that when they detonated, a lot of glass would fly around. De Palma tried the sequence with a stuntman, but it did not look convincing and he asked Cruise to do it, despite the possibility that the actor could have drowned.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt;

The script that Cruise approved called for a final showdown to take place on top of a moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the [[TGV]]&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; but rail authorities did not want any part of the stunt performed on their trains.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face.&lt;ref name="Penfield" /&gt; Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the [[Glasgow South Western Line]], between [[New Cumnock]], [[Dumfries]] and [[Annan, Dumfries and Galloway|Annan]]. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wolff |first=Ellen |title=''Mission'' Uses Sound of Silence |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=May 22, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers delivered the film on time and under budget, a rarity in Hollywood, with Cruise doing most of his own stunts.&lt;ref name="Portman" /&gt; Initially, there was a sophisticated opening sequence that introduced a love triangle between Jim Phelps, his wife Claire and Ethan Hunt that was removed because it took the test audience "out of the genre", according to De Palma.&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt; There were rumors that  Cruise and De Palma did not get along, and these rumors were fueled when the director excused himself at the last moment from scheduled media interviews before the film's theatrical release.&lt;ref name = "Portman" /&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible (soundtrack)}}
The film uses [[Lalo Schifrin]]'s original "[[Theme from Mission: Impossible]]". [[Alan Silvestri]] was originally hired to write the film's [[film score|score]], but his music was rejected and replaced with a new score by composer [[Danny Elfman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=John |date=July 15, 1996 |title=Music You Won't Hear at the Movies |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-jul-15-ca-12822-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=September 20, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some sources, Silvestri had written and recorded some 20 minutes of music, and the decision to replace him was made by producer [[Tom Cruise]] during [[post-production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.runmovies.eu/?p=4679 | title = Composer Alan Silvestri Disavowed | publisher = Runmovies.eu | place = EU | date = 2000 | first1 = Ford A. | last1 = Thaxton | first2 = Randall D. | last2 = Larson | journal = Soundtrack Magazine | volume = 19 | number = 74 }}{{dead link|date=May 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} [https://cnmsarchive.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/composer-alan-silvestri-disavowed/ Alt URL]&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman had only a few weeks to compose and produce the final score, which used Schifrin's "The Plot" theme in addition to his main theme, as well as new themes composed by Elfman for the characters [[Ethan Hunt]], Claire and the [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media notes |title=''Mission: Impossible'' - Limited Edition |others=[[Danny Elfman]] |year=2019 |first=Jeff|last=Bond |pages=5-6 |type=booklet |publisher=La-La Land Records, Inc. |id=LLLCD1411 |location=[[Los Angeles]], CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U2]] bandmates [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]] and [[Adam Clayton]] were fans of the TV show and knew the original theme music well, but were nervous about remaking Schifrin's legendary theme song.&lt;ref name="Gunderson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gunderson |first=Edna |title=U2 members on a 'Mission' remix |work=[[USA Today]] |page =12D | date=May 15, 1996 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16341979.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton put together his own version in New York City and Mullen did his in [[Dublin]] on weekends between U2 recording sessions. The two musicians were influenced by [[Brian Eno]] and the European dance club scene sound of the recently finished album ''[[Original Soundtracks 1|Passengers]]''. They allowed Polygram to pick its favorite and they wanted both. In a month, they had two versions of the song and five remixed by DJs. All seven tracks appeared on a limited edition vinyl release.&lt;ref name="Gunderson" /&gt;

The song entered the top 10 of music charts around the world, was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] in 1997, and was a critical and commercial success.{{citation needed | date = May 2012}}

==Marketing==
[[Apple Computer]] had a $15 million promotion linked to the film that included a game, print ads and television spot featuring scenes from the TV show turned into the feature film; dealer and in-theater promos; and a placement of Apple personal computers in the film. This was an attempt on Apple's part to improve their image after posting a $740 million loss in its fiscal second quarter.&lt;ref name="Enrico"&gt;{{cite news |last= Enrico |first= Dottie |title= Apple's mission: Hollywood Computer ads take new turn |work=[[USA Today]] |page =4B |date=April 30, 1996 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16362018.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Original television series cast===
Several cast members of the [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|original television series that ran from 1966–73]], reacted negatively to the film.

Actor [[Greg Morris]], who portrayed [[List of Mission: Impossible characters#Barney Collier|Barney Collier]] in the original television series, was reportedly disgusted with the film's treatment of the Phelps character, and he walked out of the theater before the film ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/9605/29/imposssibles/ | title = 'Mission: Impossible' TV stars disgruntled | publisher = CNN | date = May 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Graves]], who played Jim Phelps in the original series as well as in the [[Mission: Impossible (1988 TV series)|late-1980s revival]], also disliked how Phelps turned out in the film. Graves had been offered the chance to reprise his role from the TV series, but turned it down upon learning his character would be revealed to be a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-14/entertainment/obit.peter.graves_1_phelps-character-mission-publicist | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120709062419/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-03-14/entertainment/obit.peter.graves_1_phelps-character-mission-publicist | url-status=dead | archive-date = July 9, 2012 | publisher = CNN | title = Interview with Maggie Q | date = November 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Landau]], who portrayed [[Rollin Hand]] in the original series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, "When they were working on an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not ''Mission''. ''Mission'' was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing we were there. So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn't that good either!"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/10/29/martin-landau-is-not-interested-in-appearing-in-a-mission-impossible-movie/ | title = Martin Landau Discusses 'Mission: Impossible' Movies | publisher = MTV | type = blog | date = October 29, 2009 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091228001842/http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2009/10/29/martin-landau-is-not-interested-in-appearing-in-a-mission-impossible-movie | archive-date = December 28, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''Mission: Impossible'' opened on May 22, 1996 in a then-record 3,012 theaters, becoming the first film to be released to over 3,000 theaters in the United States, and broke the record for a film opening on Wednesday with [[United States dollar|US$]]11.8 million, beating the $11.7 million ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' made in 1991.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas | first =Karen |title= 'Mission' is successful, breaks Wednesday record | work= [[USA Today]] | page = 1D | date =May 24, 1996 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16348281.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also set house records in several theaters around the United States.&lt;ref name="Hindes"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hindes |first=Andrew |title= ''Mission'' Cruises to B.O.

===Critical response===
''Mission: Impossible'' received mainly positive reviews from critics. The film has a 64% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 58 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10, with the critical consensus reading, "Full of special effects, Brian De Palma’s update of ''Mission: Impossible'' has a lot of sweeping spectacle, but the plot is sometimes convoluted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_impossible/ |title=Mission: Impossible (1996) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |access-date=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/mission-impossible |title=Mission: Impossible Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |access-date=2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, "This is a movie that exists in the instant, and we must exist in the instant to enjoy it."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news |last=Ebert | first =Roger | author-link = Roger Ebert |title= Mission: Impossible |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date =May 31, 1996 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960531/REVIEWS/605310305/1023 |access-date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Stephen Holden]] addressed the film's convoluted plot: "If that story doesn't make a shred of sense on any number of levels, so what? Neither did the television series, in which basic credibility didn't matter so long as its sci-fi popular mechanics kept up the suspense."&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |author-link= Stephen Holden |title= Mission: Impossible | work = [[The New York Times]] |date=May 22, 1996 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/library/filmarchive/mission_impossible.html |access-date=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Clark of ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the film three out of four stars and said that it was "stylish, brisk but lacking in human dimension despite an attractive cast, the glass is either half-empty or half-full here, though the concoction goes down with ease."&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Mike |title=Should you decide to accept it, plot works |work=[[USA Today]] |page =1D |date= May 22, 1996 |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/16346878.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Hal Hinson, in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "There are empty thrills, and some suspense. But throughout the film, we keep waiting for some trace of personality, some color in the dialogue, some hipness in the staging or in the characters' attitudes. And it's not there."&lt;ref name="Hinson"&gt;{{cite news |last = Hinson |first=Hal |title=De Palma's ''Mission'' Implausible |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= May 22, 1996 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/missionimpossible.htm#hinson | access-date= 2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Richard Schickel]] wrote, "What is not present in ''Mission: Impossible'' (which, aside from the title, sound-track quotations from the theme song and self-destructing assignment tapes, has little to do with the old TV show) is a plot that logically links all these events or characters with any discernible motives beyond surviving the crisis of the moment."&lt;ref name="Schickel"&gt;{{cite news | last =Schickel |first=Richard |author-link = Richard Schickel |title=Movie: Improbable |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 27, 1996 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984610,00.html |access-date=2009-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film a "B" rating and said, "The problem isn't that the plot is too complicated; it's that each detail is given the exact same nagging emphasis. Intriguing yet mechanistic, jammed with action yet as talky and dense as a physics seminar, the studiously labyrinthine ''Mission: Impossible'' grabs your attention without quite tickling your imagination."&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |author-link=Owen Gleiberman |title= Mission: Impossible | work =[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=May 31, 1996 |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,292824,00.html | access-date=2009-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics have given the CIA break-in, and the final climactic chase sequence, particular praise often in spite of their reception of the rest of the film. Both scenes have frequently featured highly on fans and critics lists of best action scenes from this series, and have been referenced many times in other subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Top 10 Mission Impossible Scenes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw-BZyc9RrU|language=en|access-date=2020-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Room A113, California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, California - 20050723.jpg|thumb|The door of Room A113 c. 2005]]

'''A113''' (sometimes '''A-113''', '''A1-13''' or '''A11-3''') is an [[in-joke|inside joke]] and [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] in media created by alumni of [[California Institute of the Arts]], referring to the classroom used by graphic design and character animation students including [[John Lasseter]], [[Tim Burton]], [[Michael Peraza]], and [[Brad Bird]]. Bird first used it for a license plate number in the  "[[Family Dog (TV series)|Family Dog]]" episode of ''[[Amazing Stories (1985 TV series)|Amazing Stories]]''. It has appeared in other [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] movies and almost every [[Pixar]] movie.

Bird said, "I put it into every single one of my films, including my ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episodes—it's sort of my version of caricaturist [[Al Hirschfeld]]'s '[[Al Hirschfeld#Nina|Nina]]'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.salon.com/ent/col/srag/1999/08/05/bird/index.html| title = Iron without irony| accessdate = 2007-04-27| author = Michael Sragow| date = 1999-08-05| work = Salon Arts &amp; Entertainment| publisher = Salon.com| archive-url = http://www.salon.com/entertainment/col/srag/1999/08/05/bird/print.html| archive-date = 1999-08-05| quote = A113 was our classroom number. On "Family Dog" I put it on the license plate of the thieves' car. And I put it into every single one of my films ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classroom A113 is currently the first-year graphic design studio.

'''Ethan Matthew Hunt''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and the [[protagonist]] of the [[Mission: Impossible (film series)|''Mission: Impossible'' film series]]. He is portrayed by [[Tom Cruise]] in all films to date.

==Appearances==
===''Mission: Impossible'' (1996)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible (film)}}
In the first film, Hunt acts as the [[Impossible Missions Force|IMF]] [[point man]] for an experienced field team led by veteran [[Jim Phelps]] ([[Jon Voight]]), his mentor. While attempting to recover stolen files containing information on all IMF's field agents during a mission in [[Prague]], the entire team, barring Hunt, is supposedly killed and the files are stolen, leaving Hunt the only suspect as he learns that the mission was a set-up to expose a mole who had been selling secrets to a Czech arms dealer ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]). Hunt decides to steal the genuine list himself, demanding that the genuine mole be present at the exchange. He sets up a rogue team of other disavowed agents, including computer expert [[Luther Stickell]] ([[Ving Rhames]]), pilot Franz Krieger ([[Jean Reno]]), and Jim's wife Claire ([[Emmanuelle Béart]]), who had in fact survived the mission and chooses to help Ethan clear his name. Ethan later finds Jim alive and deduces that he is the real mole, working with Claire and Krieger; Jim chose to betray the IMF due to his disillusionment with the end of the [[Cold War]]. He, Claire, and Krieger intend to escape with the money for the list and frame Ethan for their crimes. Ethan works out their true agenda when Jim attempts to accuse IMF head Eugene Kittridge ([[Henry Czerny]]) of being the mole, allowing Ethan to expose their survival to Kittridge. In a final confrontation in the [[Channel Tunnel]], Claire is killed when she tries to protect Ethan in a moment of conscience, and Ethan avenges the rest of the team when he kills Jim and Krieger by destroying their escape helicopter with explosive chewing gum from the Prague mission. Ethan gets Luther reinstated as an IMF agent and considers leaving the IMF, but is offered a mission of his own during the flight home.

===''Mission: Impossible 2'' (2000)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible 2}}
In the second film, Hunt is tasked with retrieving a deadly genetically engineered virus, known as "Chimera", from a rogue IMF agent, Sean Ambrose ([[Dougray Scott]]), who intends to release the virus after acquiring a controlling influence on the company that created it so that he can profit from sales of the cure.  Hunt attempts to infiltrate Ambrose's inner circle through Ambrose's former girlfriend, Nyah Nordoff-Hall ([[Thandie Newton]]), an accomplished thief. During their mission, Hunt and Nordoff-Hall engage in an affair that complicates the mission. At the climax, Nordoff-Hall is forced to infect herself with the last virus in order to save Hunt; with Hunt having destroyed the only other traces of the virus, she was thus able to shield Hunt until he could escape. Subsequently racing against time—the virus is incurable twenty hours after infection—Hunt manages to acquire the cure and is forced to kill Ambrose.

===''Mission: Impossible III'' (2006)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible III}}
In the third film, Hunt is now a semi-retired training officer for IMF and plans a quiet life with his fiancée Julia Meade ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), who does not know about the IMF. He is called back into service to rescue a former student called Lindsey Farris ([[Keri Russell]]) captured during a mission in Germany, and recovers confidential information via stolen laptop. He is forced to once again go rogue in an attempt to track down the sadistic arms dealer, Owen Davian ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) and secure a dangerous mystery item known as the 'Rabbit's Foot'. After an impromptu ceremony, Hunt and Julia are married, only for Owen, who has a double agent working within IMF, to kidnap Julia. With the help of his IMF team: Stickell, Declan Gormley ([[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]), and Zhen Lei ([[Maggie Q]]), Hunt finds the Rabbit's foot, saves his wife, and kills Owen Davian in Shanghai.

The later film ''Mission: Impossible – Fallout'' confirms that Ethan and Julia were happy for a while, but their marriage was tainted every time they heard a disaster due to the possibility that Ethan could have done something to stop it.

===''Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol'' (2011)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol}}
In the fourth film, Hunt&amp;mdash;having just escaped from a deep-cover mission in prison&amp;mdash;and his IMF team are blamed for an attack that destroys the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], resulting in the disavowal of the entire IMF. Despite lacking their usual resources, connections, technology, and backup, their mission is to find and stop Kurt Hendricks ([[Michael Nyqvist]]), a former Soviet nuclear strategist who is intent on starting a nuclear war to usher in the next era of human evolution. As they chase Hendricks to [[Dubai]] and on to [[Mumbai|Mumbai, India]], they themselves are pursued by a team of Russian agents trying to apprehend them. The team becomes increasingly fractured as individual members fight their own demons while trying to trust the others. Hunt manages to pull the team together, stop a nuclear bomb and clear the IMF of any involvement in the Kremlin attack. It is also revealed that Hunt had Julia's death faked to protect her, something only he and the Secretary of IMF knew about, giving him the pretext to infiltrate the prison his team freed him from in the opening scenes.

===''Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation'' (2015)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation}}
In the fifth film, Hunt is assigned a mission that culminates in him hanging outside of an A400M military aircraft 5,000 feet above the ground in Belarus to recover a package that contains [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]] nerve gas. Although this mission succeeds, when he learns that the thieves responsible for stealing the gas lacked the connections to do so, Hunt begins to uncover evidence of the existence of the Syndicate, a consortium of covert operatives who wreak terrorist attacks worldwide. After Hunt is forced to go off-the-grid when he is nearly killed by a Syndicate operative and the IMF is disbanded and absorbed into the CIA due to its controversial and destructive methods, he spends six months trying to track the Syndicate. Eventually, he and his former team learn that the Syndicate was actually originally a British project to perform missions without oversight, but British agent Solomon Lane ([[Sean Harris]]) took the plans and went rogue, now seeking to steal files that would grant him access to various established bank accounts to finance future Syndicate operations. Refusing to allow the Syndicate to continue, Hunt and his team are able to capture Lane, with CIA Director Alan Hunley ([[Alec Baldwin]]) subsequently forced to claim that the disbanding of IMF was a cover to allow them to track the Syndicate.

===''Mission: Impossible – Fallout'' (2018)===
{{Main|Mission: Impossible – Fallout}}
In the sixth film, an IMF mission goes wrong when Ethan chooses to save Luther after his friend is taken hostage, allowing a splinter group of the Syndicate, known as the Apostles, to gain access to three plutonium cores that could be used to create nuclear weapons. Forced to work with CIA agent August Walker ([[Henry Cavill]]), Ethan is able to assume the identity of Apostle contact John Lark (Liang Yang) and acquire one of the cores in exchange for breaking Solomon Lane out of prison – despite opposition from Ilsa Faust, now under orders to kill Lane or bring him back to Britain – but he, Luther and Benji later use Lane to trick Walker into revealing that ''he'' is Lark. When the Secretary is killed by Walker, Ethan's team and Ilsa track Walker and Lane to a medical aid camp where Julia, Ethan's estranged wife, is currently working, Ethan realizing that Lane and Walker intend to detonate the bombs there for both the personal reason of hurting Ethan and the wider-scale reason that such a nuclear detonation would contaminate the water supply for almost a third of the world's population. While Luther, Julia, Benji and Ilsa disable the bombs and confront Lane, Ethan is forced to steal a helicopter that he doesn't know how to fly to pursue Walker and acquire the bomb detonator, culminating in a desperate struggle on a steep cliff that ends with Walker forced off the cliff. With the crisis concluded, Ethan's reputation and the reputation of the IMF is redeemed in the eyes of the CIA, who muse that Ethan's focus on individual lives is important for his superiors as it allows them to focus on the biggest picture.

===Video games===
Aside from the ''Mission: Impossible'' films, Ethan Hunt has appeared in the [[Mission: Impossible (1998 video game)|1998 video game]] based on the first film and the 2003 video game ''[[Mission: Impossible – Operation Surma]]'', voiced by [[Steve Blum]]. He also appears as a playable character in the crossover game ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', with archive recordings of [[Tom Cruise]] being used for his voice.

==Reception==
As of March 2020, Hunt was voted #31 on Ranker's "The Most Hardcore Big Screen Action Heroes".&lt;ref&gt;https://m.ranker.com/crowdranked-list/the-most-badass-big-screen-action-heroes&lt;/ref&gt;

Vlad Dima, writing in ''[[Bright Lights Film Journal]]'', said while the series succeeds due to "inventive, over-the-top stunts, the relentless trickery, and ultimately... Tom Cruise's star-power", he said, "One less obvious element, though, is a myth that slowly develops over the span of the series and comes to full bloom in ''Fallout''... [is Ethan] Hunt's eternal quest... to become the perfect man."

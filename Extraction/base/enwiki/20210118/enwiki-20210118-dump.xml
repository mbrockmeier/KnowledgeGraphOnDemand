Though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime, Schopenhauer had a posthumous impact across various disciplines, including [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]]. His writing on [[Schopenhauer's aesthetics|aesthetics]], [[morality]], and [[psychology]] have influenced many thinkers and artists.

This awareness of the lack of free will keeps me from taking myself and my fellow men too seriously as acting and deciding individuals, and from losing my temper."

=== Early life ===
[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house, ul. Św. Ducha (formerly Heiligegeistgasse)]]
Schopenhauer was born on 22 February 1788, in Danzig (then part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]; present-day [[Gdańsk]], [[Poland]]) on Heiligegeistgasse (present day Św. Ducha 47), the son of [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] (née Trosiener) and Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer,&lt;ref name="Google Books"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fW5Dl-tUS_oC&amp;q=Schopenhauer+%2222+February%22&amp;pg=PR30|title=Chronology|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|author2=Günter Zöller|author3=Eric F. J.

Neither of them was very religious;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; both supported the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and were [[Republicanism|republicans]], [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitans]] and [[Anglophilia|Anglophiles]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  When Danzig became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in 1793, Heinrich moved to [[Hamburg]]—a free city with a republican constitution, protected by Britain and Holland against Prussian aggression—although his firm continued trading in Danzig where most of their extended families remained.  [[Adele Schopenhauer|Adele]], Arthur's only sibling was born on 12 July 1797.

In 1797 Arthur was sent to [[Le Havre]] to live for two years with the family of his father's business associate, Grégoire de Blésimaire. He seemed to enjoy his stay there, learned to speak French fluently and started a friendship with Jean Anthime Grégoire de Blésimaire, his peer, which lasted for a large part of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as 1799, Arthur started playing the flute.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}  In 1803 he joined his parents on their long tour of [[Netherlands|Holland]], Britain, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]]; it was mostly a pleasure tour although Heinrich also visited some of his business associates. Heinrich gave his son a choice—he could stay at home and start preparations for university education, or he could travel with them and then continue his merchant education. Arthur later deeply regretted his choice because he found his merchant training tedious. He spent twelve weeks of the tour attending a school in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] where he was very unhappy and appalled by strict but intellectually shallow [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] religiosity, which he continued to sharply criticize later in life despite his general Anglophilia.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He was also under pressure from his father who became very critical of his educational results. Heinrich became so fussy that even his wife started to doubt his mental health.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, Heinrich died by drowning in a canal by their home in Hamburg. Although it was possible that his death was accidental, his wife and son believed that it was suicide because he was very prone to unsociable behavior, [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] which became especially pronounced in his last months of life.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), p. 12. "There was in the father's life some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in Hamburg."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  Arthur showed similar moodiness since his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father; there were also several other instances of serious mental health issues on his father's side of family.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Johanna was generally described as vivacious and sociable.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt;  Despite the hardships, Schopenhauer seemed to like his father and later mentioned him always in a positive light.&lt;ref name="autogenerated43"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich Schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among Johanna and the children. Arthur Schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority. He invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father, and because of his own doubts about being too old to start a life of a scholar.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his prior education was practical merchant training and he had some trouble with learning Latin which was a prerequisite for any academic career.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; His mother moved, with her daughter Adele, to [[Weimar]]—then the centre of [[German literature]]—to enjoy social life among writers and artists. Arthur and his mother were not on good terms. In one letter to him she wrote, "You are unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit, and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Wallace|first= W.|date= 2003|title= Life of Arthur Schopenhauer|location= Honolulu|publisher= University Press of the Pacific|page= 59|isbn= 978-1410206411}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur left his mother, and though she died 24 years later, they never met again. Some negative opinions of the later philosopher about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, The Story of Philosophy, Garden City Publishing Co., Inc., New York, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;
Arthur lived in Hamburg with his friend Jean Anthime who was also studying to become a merchant.

After quitting his merchant apprenticeship, with some encouragement from his mother, he dedicated himself to studies at the [[Ernestine Gymnasium, Gotha]], in [[Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg]], but he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility, spending large amounts of money which caused concern to his frugal mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;  He left the Gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters.  Although Arthur claimed that he left voluntarily, his mother's letter indicates that he was expelled.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
He moved to Weimar but didn't live with his mother, who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they wouldn't get along very well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences. He accused his mother of being financially irresponsible, flirtatious and seeking to remarry, which he considered an insult to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated131"/&gt; His mother, while professing her love to him, criticized him sharply for being moody, tactless, and argumentative—and urged him to improve his behavior so he would not alienate people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"/&gt; Arthur concentrated on his studies which were now going very well and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls, parties and theater. By that time Johanna's famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries, most celebrated of them being [[Goethe]]. Arthur attended her parties, usually when he knew that Goethe would be there—though the famous writer and statesman didn't even seem to notice the young and unknown student. It is possible that Goethe kept distance because Johanna warned him about her son's depressive and combative nature, or because Goethe was then on bad terms with Arthur's language instructor and roommate, [[Franz Passow]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful [[Karoline Jagemann]], mistress of [[Karl August, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]], and he wrote to her his only known love poem.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality, Schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs, usually with women of lower social status, such as servants, actresses, and sometimes even paid prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to his friend Anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out-of-wedlock daughters (born in 1819 and 1836), both of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In their youthful correspondence Arthur and Anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but Schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually didn't find him very charming or physically attractive, and his desires often remained unfulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

He left Weimar to become a student at the [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in 1809. There are no written reasons about why Schopenhauer chose that university instead of the then more famous [[University of Jena]] but Göttingen was known as more modern and scientifically oriented, with less attention given to theology.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Law or medicine were usual choices for young men of Schopenhauer's status who also needed career and income; he chose [[medicine]] due to his [[Natural science|scientific interests]]. Among his notable professors were [[Bernhard Friedrich Thibaut]], [[Arnold Hermann Ludwig Heeren]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], [[Friedrich Stromeyer]], [[Heinrich Adolf Schrader]], [[Johann Tobias Mayer]] and [[Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 141–144&lt;/ref&gt; He studied [[metaphysics]], [[psychology]] and [[logic]] under [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], the author of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]'', who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; He decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810–11 and he left Göttingen which didn't have a strong philosophy program (besides Schulze the only other philosophy professor was [[Friedrich Bouterwek]] whom Schopenhauer disliked&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;). He didn't regret his medicinal and scientific studies. He claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher, and even in Berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; During his days at Göttingen, he spent considerable time studying, but also continued his flute playing and social life. His friends included [[Friedrich Gotthilf Osann]], [[Karl Witte]], [[Christian Charles Josias von Bunsen]], and [[William Backhouse Astor Sr.]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived to the newly founded [[University of Berlin]] for the winter semester of 1811–12.  At the same time his mother just started her literary career; she published her first book in 1810, a biography of her friend [[Karl Ludwig Fernow]], which was a critical success. Arthur attended lectures by the prominent [[post-Kantian]] philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ''Wissenschaftslehre'' and he also found his lectures tedious and hard to understand.&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He later mentioned Fichte only in critical, negative terms&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt;—seeing his philosophy as a lower quality version of Kant's and considering it useful only because Fichte's poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of Kantianism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 165–169&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended the lectures of the famous Protestant theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], whom he also quickly came to dislike.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; His notes and comments on Schleiermacher's lectures show that Schopenhauer was becoming very [[Criticism of religion|critical of religion]] and moving towards [[atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; He learned by self-directed reading; besides Plato, Kant and Fichte he also read the works of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Jakob Friedrich Fries|Fries]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi|Jacobi]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[John Locke|Locke]], and much current scientific literature.&lt;ref name="autogenerated170"/&gt; He attended philological courses by [[August Böckh]] and [[Friedrich August Wolf]] and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Paul Erman]], [[Johann Elert Bode]], [[Ernst Gottfried Fischer]], [[Johann Horkel]], [[Friedrich Christian Rosenthal]] and [[Hinrich Lichtenstein]] (Lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mother's parties in Weimar).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 171–174&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early work ===
Schopenhauer left Berlin in a rush in 1813 fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as Prussia just joined the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war against France]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Weimar but left after less than a month disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover, Georg Friedrich Konrad Ludwig Müller von Gerstenbergk (1778–1838), a civil servant twelve years younger than she was; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his father's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; He settled for a while in [[Rudolstadt]] hoping that no army would pass through the small town.  He spent his time in solitude, [[hiking]] in the mountains and the [[Thuringian forest]] and writing his dissertation, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]''. He completed his dissertation at about the same time as the French army was defeated at the [[Battle of Leipzig]]. He became irritated by the arrival of soldiers to the town and accepted his mother's invitation to visit her in Weimar. She tried to convince him that her relationship with Gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intentions of remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; But Schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with Gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented, pretentious, and [[German nationalism|nationalistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; His mother just published her second book, ''Reminiscences of a Journey in the Years 1803, 1804, and 1805'', a description of their family tour of Europe, which quickly became a hit. She found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy. In a fit of temper Arthur told her that people would read his work long after the "rubbish" she wrote was totally forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/Schopenhauer.html |title=Schopenhauer: A Pessimist in the Optimistic Month of May |publisher=Germanic American Institute |access-date=12 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611051923/http://courseweb.stthomas.edu/paschons/language_http/essays/schopenhauer.html |archive-date=11 June 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/selectedessaysof033377mbp/selectedessaysof033377mbp_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Selected Essays Of Schopenhauer" |access-date=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although they considered her novels of dubious quality, the [[F.A. Brockhaus AG|Brockhaus publishing firm]] held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well. Hans Brockhaus (1888–1965) later claimed that his predecessors "...saw nothing in this manuscript, but wanted to please one of our best-selling authors by publishing her son's work. We published more and more of her son Arthur's work and today nobody remembers Johanna, but her son's works are in steady demand and contribute to Brockhaus'[s] reputation."&lt;ref name=mom&gt;{{citation |last=Fredriksson |first=Einar H. |contribution=The Dutch Publishing Scene: Elsevier and North-Holland |pages=61–76 |title=A Century of Science Publishing: A Collection of Essays |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwWrRYyck6AC&amp;pg=PA61 |editor-last=Fredriksson |editor-first=Einar H. |display-editors=0 |isbn=978-4-274-90424-0 |publisher=IOS Press |location=Amsterdam |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He kept large portraits of the pair in his office in [[Leipzig]] for the edification of his new editors.&lt;ref name=mom/&gt;

Also contrary to his mother's prediction, Schopenhauer's dissertation made an impression on Goethe to whom he sent it as a gift.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is doubtful that Goethe agreed with Schopenhauer's philosophical positions he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero. They mostly discussed Goethe's newly published (and somewhat lukewarmly received) work on [[Theory of Colours|color theory]]. Schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject, ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'', which in many points differed from his teacher's. Although they remained polite towards each other, their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially Schopenhauer's tactless criticisms and extreme self-confidence—soon made Goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection, but he continued to praise Goethe, and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important experience during his stay in Weimar was his acquaintance with Friedrich Majer – a [[historian of religion]], [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and disciple of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] – who introduced him to [[Eastern philosophy]]{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}}&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Indology|Indology]]). Schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the ''[[Upanishads]]'' (he called them "the production of the highest human wisdom", and believed they contained superhuman concepts.) and the [[Buddha]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}} and put them at par with Plato and Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; He continued his studies by reading the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', an amateurish German journal ''Asiatisches Magazin'' and ''Asiatick Researches'' by [[The Asiatic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Schopenhauer held profound respect for [[Indian philosophy]];{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-69}} although he loved [[Hindu texts]] he was more interested in [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=76-77}} which he came to regard as the best religion.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, his studies on Hindu and Buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=69}} and the latter were mostly restricted to [[Early Buddhism]]. He also claimed that he formulated most of his ideas independently,{{sfn|Clarke|1997|pages=67-68}} and only later realized the similarities with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 274–276&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Arthur Schopenhauer Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl 1815.jpeg|thumb|Schopenhauer in 1815. Portrait by Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl]]
As the relationship with his mother fell to a new low he left Weimar and moved to [[Dresden]] in May 1814.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He continued his philosophical studies, enjoyed the cultural life, socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; His friends in Dresden were [[Johann Gottlob von Quandt]], [[Friedrich Laun]], [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] and Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl, a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of Schopenhauer's unattractive physical features.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;  His criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; However, his main occupation during his stay in Dresden was his seminal philosophical work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Although the first volume was published by December 1818, it was printed with a title page erroneously giving the year as 1819 (see {{citation |last=Braunschweig |first=Yael |contribution=Schopenhauer and Rossinian Universiality: On the Italianate in Schopenhauer's Metaphysics of Music &lt;!--|pp=283–304--&gt; |title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ |editor-last=Mathew |editor-first=Nicholas |editor2-last=Walton |editor2-first=Benjamin |display-editors=0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=[[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]] |date=2013 |isbn=978-0-521-76805-4 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NQ_3AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA297 297, n. 7]}}).&lt;/ref&gt; He was recommended to [[Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus]] by Baron Ferdinand von Biedenfeld, an acquaintance of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Although the publisher accepted his manuscript, Schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude and very poor sales of the book after it was published in December 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 285–289&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1818, while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy,&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer left Dresden for a yearlong vacation in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; He visited [[Venice]], [[Bologna]], [[Florence]], [[Naples]] and [[Milan]], travelling alone or accompanied by mostly English tourists he met.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; He spent winter months in [[Rome]] where he accidentally met his acquaintance [[Karl Witte]] and engaged in numerous quarrels with German tourists in [[Antico Caffè Greco|Caffe Greco]], among them [[Johann Friedrich Böhmer]] who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed art, architecture, ancient ruins, attended plays and operas, continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 346–350&lt;/ref&gt; One of his affairs supposedly became serious, and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich Italian noblewoman—but despite his mentioning this several times, no details are known and it may have been Schopenhauer exaggerating.&lt;ref&gt;Safranski, Rüdiger (1991) ''Schopenhauer and the Wild Years of Philosophy''. Harvard University Press. p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; He corresponded regularly with his sister Adele and became close to her as her relationship with Johanna and Gerstenbergk also deteriorated.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 344&lt;/ref&gt; She informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of A. L. Muhl in Danzig—in which her mother invested their whole savings and Arthur a third of his—was near bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur offered to share his assets but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while Arthur, using his business knowledge, took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 354–356&lt;/ref&gt;  The affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of Schopenhauer family.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 354&lt;/ref&gt;

He shortened his stay in Italy because of the trouble with Muhl and returned to Dresden.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; Disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him both with income and the opportunity to promote his views.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted his friends at universities in Heidelberg, Göttingen and Berlin and found [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] most attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 358–362&lt;/ref&gt; He scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], whom Schopenhauer described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason," p. 1 ([[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]] on Wikisource.)&lt;/ref&gt;  He was especially appalled by Hegel's supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in March 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time when many progressive professors were [[Carlsbad Decrees|fired]], while Schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own, Hegel still voted to accept Schopenhauer to the university.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students turned up to Schopenhauer's lectures, and he dropped out of [[academia]]. A late essay, "On University Philosophy", expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies.

=== Later life ===
[[File:Arthur Shopengauer by Gennadij Jerszow.jpg|thumb|upright|Sculpture of Arthur Schopenhauer by [[Gdańsk]] based artist [[Giennadij Jerszow]].]]
After his academic failure he continued to travel extensively, visiting [[Leipzig]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Vevey]], [[Milan]] and spending eight months in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 411&lt;/ref&gt;  However, before he left for his three-year travel, he had an incident with his Berlin neighbor, forty-seven-year-old seamstress Caroline Louise Marquet.  The details of the August 1821 incident are unknown. He claimed that he just pushed her from his entrance after she rudely refused to leave, and she purposely fell on the ground so she could sue him.  She claimed that he attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work.  She immediately sued him, and the process lasted until May 1827, when a court found Schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 408–411&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer enjoyed Italy, where he studied art and socialized with Italian and English nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 411–414&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his last visit to the country.  He left for [[Munich]] and stayed there for a year, mostly recuperating from various health issues, some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases (the treatment his doctor used suggests [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 415&lt;/ref&gt;  He contacted publishers offering to translate Hume into German and Kant into English but his proposals were declined.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;  Returning to Berlin he began to study Spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language.  He liked [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Miguel de Cervantes]], and especially [[Baltasar Gracián]].&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 420&lt;/ref&gt;  He also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works.  Few attempts to revive his lectures—again scheduled at the same time as Hegel's—also failed, as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 429–432&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Berlin years Schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 432&lt;/ref&gt;  For a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17-year-old Flora Weiss, who was 22 years younger than he was.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;  His unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of [[monogamy]] but still not advocating [[polygyny]]—instead musing about a [[Polyamory|polyamorous]] relationship he called ''tetragamy''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 404–408&lt;/ref&gt;  He had an on and off relationship with a young dancer [[Caroline Medon|Caroline Richter]] (she also used surname Medon after one of her ex-lovers).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; They met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the Berlin Opera. She had already had numerous lovers and a son out-of-wedlock, and later gave birth to another son, this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat. (She soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn).&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; As Schopenhauer was preparing to escape Berlin in 1831, due to a [[cholera]] epidemic, he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left behind her young son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; She refused and he went alone; in his will he left her a significant sum of money but insisted that it should not be in any way spent on her second son.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Schopenhauer claimed that in his last year in Berlin, he had a [[Premonition|prophetic dream]] that urged him to escape the city.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; As he arrived in his new home in [[Frankfurt]] he supposedly had another [[Supernatural|supernatural experience]], an apparition of his dead father and his mother, who was still alive.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; This experience led him to spend some time investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena and [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. He was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent, but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 437–452&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival in Frankfurt he experienced a period of depression and declining health.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 454&lt;/ref&gt; He renewed his correspondence with his mother, and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 454–457&lt;/ref&gt; By now Johanna and Adele were living very modestly. Johanna's writing didn't bring her much income, and her popularity was waning.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 458&lt;/ref&gt; Their correspondence remained reserved, and Arthur Schopenhauer seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; His relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1832 Schopenhauer left Frankfurt for [[Mannheim]] but returned in July 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life, except for a few short journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; He lived alone except for a succession of pet [[poodle]]s named [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] and Butz. In 1836, he published ''[[On the Will in Nature]]''. In 1836 he sent his essay "[[On the Freedom of the Will]]" to the contest of the ''Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences'' and won the prize next year.  He sent another essay, "[[On the Basis of Morality]]", to the ''Royal Danish Society for Scientific Studies'' but didn't win the prize despite being the only contestant.  The Society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner, claimed that the essay missed the point and that the arguments were not adequate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer, who was very self-confident that he would win, was enraged by this rejection. He published both essays as "The Two Basic Problems of Ethics" and in the preface to the second edition of this book, in 1860, he was still pouring insults on Royal Danish Society.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 484&lt;/ref&gt; First edition, published in 1841, again failed to draw attention to his philosophy. Two years later, after some negotiations, he managed to convince his publisher, Brockhaus, to print the second, updated edition of ''The World as Will and Representation''.  The book was again mostly ignored and few reviews were mixed or negative. 
 
However, Schopenhauer did start to attract some followers, mostly outside academia, among practical professionals (several of them were lawyers) who pursued private philosophical studies. He jokingly referred to them as ''evangelists'' and ''apostles''.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 504&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most active early followers was [[Julius Frauenstädt]] who wrote numerous articles promoting Schopenhauer's philosophy. He was also instrumental in finding another publisher after Brockhaus refused to publish ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' believing that it would be another failure.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 506&lt;/ref&gt; Though Schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him, claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas, Frauenstädt continued to promote Schopenhauer's work.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 507–508&lt;/ref&gt; They renewed their communication in 1859 and Schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the editor of the first collected works of Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;

In 1848 Schopenhauer witnessed [[German revolutions of 1848–49|violent upheaval]] in Frankfurt after General [[Hans Adolf Erdmann von Auerswald]] and Prince [[Felix Lichnowsky]] were murdered. He became worried for his own safety and property.&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier in life he had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a friendly welcome to Austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels.&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; The rebellion passed without any loss to Schopenhauer and he later praised [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] for restoring order.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;  He even modified his will, leaving a large part of his property to a Prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Young Hegelians]] were advocating change and progress Schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans—and that even if some utopian society were established, people would still fight each other out of boredom, or would starve due to overpopulation.&lt;ref name="auto7"/&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer.jpg|thumb|left|1855 painting of Schopenhauer by Jules Lunteschütz]]
In 1851 Schopenhauer published ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', which, as the title says, contains essays that are supplementary to his main work. It was his first successful, widely read book, partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 524&lt;/ref&gt; The essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually didn't contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 539&lt;/ref&gt;  Many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but didn't take his philosophy seriously.&lt;ref name="auto8"/&gt; His early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those Fichte and Schelling,&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 381–386&lt;/ref&gt; or claim that there are numerous contradictions in his philosophy.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Both criticisms enraged Schopenhauer. However, he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights, but encouraged his disciples to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; His private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions, inconsistencies, and vagueness in his philosophy, but claimed that he wasn't concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 394&lt;/ref&gt; and that some of his ideas shouldn't be taken literally but instead as metaphors.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work. In 1856 University of Leipzig sponsored an essay contest about Schopenhauer's philosophy, which was won by [[Rudolf Seydel]]’s very critical essay.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's friend [[Jules Lunteschütz]] made a first of his four portraits of him—which Schopenhauer didn't particularly like—that was soon sold to a wealthy landowner Carl Ferdinand Wiesike who built a house to display it.  Schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this, and would claim that it was his first chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 540&lt;/ref&gt; As his fame increased copies of his paintings and photographs were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he lived and wrote his works.  People visited Frankfurt's ''Englischer Hof'' to observe him dining. Admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  He complained, however, that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends already died from old age.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 542&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schopenhauer-ffm001.jpg|thumb|right|Grave at Frankfurt ''Hauptfriedhof'']]
He remained healthy in his old age, which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather, and always getting enough sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 544–545&lt;/ref&gt; He had a great appetite and could read without glasses but his [[Hearing loss|hearing]] was declining since his youth and he developed problems with [[rheumatism]].&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 545&lt;/ref&gt; He remained active and lucid, continued his reading, writing and correspondences until his death.&lt;ref name="auto10"/&gt; The numerous notes that he made during these years, amongst others on aging, were published [[Posthumous publication|posthumously]] under the title ''Senilia''. In the spring of 1860 his health started to decline, he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations; in September he suffered inflammation of the lungs and although he was starting to recover he remained very weak.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). p. 546&lt;/ref&gt; His last friend to visit him was Wilhelm Gwinner and, according to him, Schopenhauer was concerned that he wouldn't be able to finish his planned additions to ''Parerga and Paralipomena'' but was at peace with dying.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright (2010). pp. 546–547&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[Respiratory failure|pulmonary-respiratory failure]],&lt;ref&gt;Dale Jacquette, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', Routledge, 2015: "Biographical sketch".&lt;/ref&gt; on 21 September 1860 while sitting at home on his couch. He was 72.&lt;ref&gt;''Schopenhauer: his life and philosophy'' by H. Zimmern – 1932 – G. Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

=== The world as representation ===
Schopenhauer saw his philosophy as a continuation of Kant's, and used the results of Kantian epistemological investigation ([[transcendental idealism]]) as starting point for his own. Kant had argued the [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our [[mental representation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|at=§ 52c|translator-last=Paul Carus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work: "The world is my representation" (''Die Welt ist meine Vorstellung''). Everything there is for cognition (the entire world) exists simply as an object in relation to a subject—a 'representation' to a subject. Everything that belongs to the world is, therefore, 'subject-dependent.' In Book One of ''The World as Will and Representation,'' Schopenhauer considers the world from this angle (i.e. insofar as it is representation.)

=== Theory of perception ===
In November 1813 [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] invited Schopenhauer to help him on his [[Theory of Colours]]. Although Schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter,&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Goethe on 23 January 1816. Ich weiß, daß durch mich die Wahrheit geredet hat, – in dieser kleinen Sache, wie dereinst in größern.&lt;/ref&gt; he accepted the invitation out of admiration for Goethe. Nevertheless, these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology: finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality.

Kant openly admitted that it was [[David Hume|Hume]]'s skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is a priori. After [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze|G. E. Schulze]] had made it plausible that Kant had not disproven Hume's skepticism, it was up to those loyal to Kant's project to prove this important matter.

The difference between the approach of Kant and Schopenhauer was this: Kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is "given" to us from outside, an expression with which Schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|volume=Vol 1. Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy|quote=But the whole teaching of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-repeated meaningless expression: 'The empirical element in perception is given from without.' ... always through the same meaningless metaphorical expression: 'The empirical perception is given us.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; He, on the other hand, was occupied with: how do we get this empirical content of perception; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations ''limited to my skin'' as the objective perception of things that lie ''outside'' of me?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=§ 21|quote=For sensation is and remains a process within the organism and is limited, as such, to the region within the skin; it cannot therefore contain any thing which lies beyond that region, or, in other words, anything that is outside us. ... It is only when the Understanding begins to apply its sole form, the causal law, that a powerful transformation takes place, by which subjective sensation becomes objective perception.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|The sensations in the hand of a man born blind, on feeling an object of cubic shape, are quite uniform and the same on all sides and in every direction: the edges, it is true, press upon a smaller portion of his hand, still nothing at all like a cube is contained in these sensations. His Understanding, however, draws the immediate and intuitive conclusion from the resistance felt, that this resistance must have a cause, which then presents itself through that conclusion as a hard body; and through the movements of his arms in feeling the object, while the hand's sensation remains unaltered, he constructs the cubic shape in Space. If the representation of a cause and of Space, together with their laws, had not already existed within him, the image of a cube could never have proceeded from those successive sensations in his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=§ 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions, but objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality. Hereby Hume's skepticism is disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|volume=Vol. 1, § 4.|quote=The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of causality of all experience,—that is, its a priori character—can only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it; and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose it, but is presupposed by it as a condition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this intellectual operation, comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause, the external world arises. With vision, finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines. We are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object; that inverts the impression on the retinas, and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance.

Schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation. He set out his theory of perception for the first time in ''[[On Vision and Colors]]'',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and, in the subsequent editions of Fourfold Root, an extensive exposition is given in § 21.

=== The world as will ===
{{main|The World as Will and Representation}}

In Book Two of ''The World as Will and Representation,'' Schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to us—i.e., the aspect of the world beyond representation, the world considered "[[thing-in-itself|in itself]]," its inner essence. The very being in itself of all things, Schopenhauer argues, is will (''Wille''). The empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in a spatio-temporal framework. The world as thing in itself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time. Though the world manifests itself to our experience as a multiplicity of objects (the ''objectivation'' of the will), each element of this multiplicity has the same blind striving essence towards existence and life. Human rationality is merely a secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental, essential level. The advanced cognitive abilities of humans, Schopenhauer argues, serve the ends of willing—an illogical, directionless, ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to a life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose. Schopenhauer's philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|metaphysical voluntarism]].

For Schopenhauer, understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns (see the [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Ethics|ethics section below]] for further detail), which he explores in the Fourth Book of ''The World as Will and Representation'' and again in his two prize essays on ethics, ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]'' and ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]''. No individual human actions are free, Schopenhauer argues, because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason: a person's actions are a necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human. Necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance, and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing. Albert Einstein quoted the Schopenhauerian idea that "a man can ''do'' as he will, but not ''will'' as he will."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1935). ''The World as I See It'', p. 14. Snowball Publishing. {{ISBN|1494877066}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the will as thing in itself is free, as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason.

According to Schopenhauer, salvation from our miserable existence can come through the will's being 'tranquillized' by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion. The saint or 'great soul' intuitively "recognizes the whole, comprehends its essence, and finds that it is constantly passing away, caught up in vain strivings, inner conflict, and perpetual suffering."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation, Vol. 1'', §68&lt;/ref&gt; The negation of the will, in other words, stems from the insight that the world in itself (free from the forms of space and time) is one. [[Asceticism|Ascetic]] practices, Schopenhauer remarks, are used to aid the will's 'self-abolition,' which brings about a blissful, redemptive 'will-less' state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering.

=== Art and aesthetics ===
{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}
[[File:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|In his main work, Schopenhauer praised the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch Golden Age artists]], who "directed such purely objective perception to the most insignificant objects, and set up a lasting monument of their objectivity and spiritual peace in paintings of ''[[still life]].'' The aesthetic beholder does not contemplate this without emotion."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 1, §38&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For Schopenhauer, human "willing"—desiring, craving, etc.—is at the root of [[suffering]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation. Here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal Platonic ''Ideas''—in other words, cognizance that is free from the service of will. In aesthetic contemplation, one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated; rather "it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it, and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception, but the two have become one, the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by a single perceptual image."&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation,'' Vol. 1, §34&lt;/ref&gt; Subject and object are no longer distinguishable, and the ''Idea'' comes to the fore.

From this aesthetic immersion one is no longer an individual who suffers as a result of servitude to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a "pure, will-less, painless, timeless, subject of cognition." The pure, will-less subject of cognition is cognizant only of Ideas, not individual things: this is a kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (time, space, cause and effect) and instead involves complete absorption in the object.

Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict the essence/pure Ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, therefore as an individual object. According to [[Daniel Albright]], "Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, p. 39, footnote 34&lt;/ref&gt; He deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.&lt;ref name=Music &gt;{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=10|isbn=978-0-14-044227-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162 162]|url=https://archive.org/details/essaysaphorisms00scho/page/162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
Schopenhauer's [[Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the [[axiom]]—and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held was directly evident from [[intuition|intuitive perception]].

{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom (also known as the fifth postulate). The axiom asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of "less than two right angles"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, ch. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Throughout his writings,&lt;ref&gt;"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy&amp;nbsp;..." – ''The World as Will and Representation.'', ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.

{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem&amp;nbsp;...}}

Although Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.&lt;ref&gt;This comment by Schopenhauer was called "an acute observation" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, "Note on Common Notion 4", Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark "was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory". Helmholtz had "maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space" and is therefore "dependent on mechanics".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,&lt;ref&gt;What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another", is not rather attacked. For ''"coinciding with one another"'' is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;}}
This follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;"Motion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience." (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|On the Basis of Morality}}
Schopenhauer asserts that the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done, but to investigate moral actions. As such, he states that philosophy is always theoretical: its task to explain what is given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, § 53.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kant's transcendental idealism, space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity. Reality [[thing-in-itself|in itself]] is free from multiplicity, not in the sense that an object is one, but that it is outside the ''possibility'' of multiplicity. Two individuals, though they appear distinct, are in-themselves not distinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, § 23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearances are entirely subordinated to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. The egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can.

What is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self-interest. If we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support ''their'' needs instead of his ''own'' pleasures, then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes ''less distinction between himself'' and others than is usually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, § 66.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding how things ''appear'' to us, the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals, but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own. In the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals, though they appear as distinct from himself.

What motivates the altruist is compassion. The suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent, but he feels connectiveness to all beings. Compassion is thus the basis of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Basis of Morality|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=§ 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eternal justice ====
Schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the ''[[principium individuationis]]''. When we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence. Individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others—the will, as the only thing that exists, has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure. This is a fundamental characteristic of the will, and cannot be circumvented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parerga and Paralipomena|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 2, § 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike temporal, or human justice, which requires time to repay an evil deed and, "has its seat in the state, as requiting and punishing",&lt;ref&gt;World as Will and Idea Vol. 1 § 63&lt;/ref&gt; eternal justice "rules not the state but the world, is not dependent upon human institutions, is not subject to chance and deception, is not uncertain, wavering, and erring, but infallible, fixed, and sure." &lt;ref name="World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63"&gt;World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63&lt;/ref&gt; Eternal justice is not retributive because retribution requires time. There are no delays or reprieves. Instead, punishment is tied to the offence, "to the point where the two become one."... "Tormenter and tormented are one. The [Tormenter] errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering; the [tormented], in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt."&lt;ref name="World as will and idea Vol. 1 § 63"/&gt;

Suffering is the moral outcome of our attachment to pleasure. Schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by Christian dogma of [[original sin]] and, in Eastern religions, the [[Reincarnation|dogma of rebirth.]]

==== Quietism ====
He who sees through the ''principium individuationis'' and comprehends suffering ''in general'' as his own, will see suffering everywhere, and instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation, will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering. For him, a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, § 68.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life, but exhibit asceticism and quietism, meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives, are not concerned about their individual welfare, and accept the evil others inflict on them without resisting. They welcome poverty and do not seek or flee death.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt; Schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live.

Human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and, instead of continuing their struggle, the ascetic breaks it. It does not matter if these ascetics adhered to the dogmata of Christianity or [[Dharmic faith|Dharmic religions]], since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge.

{{Quotation|The [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] and the teacher of the [[Vedanta philosophy]] agree in this respect also, they both regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dullness likes to assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of its excellence.&lt;ref name="Ascetic"/&gt;}}

=== Psychology ===
Philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex, but Schopenhauer addressed it and related concepts forthrightly:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;one ought rather to be surprised that a thing [sex] which plays throughout so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw and untreated material.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation: Supplements to the Fourth Book'']]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason: the Will to Live or Will to Life (''Wille zum Leben''), defined as an inherent drive within human beings, and all creatures, to stay alive; a force that inveigles&lt;ref name="inveigles"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Schopenhauer|isbn=978-0-19-861248-3|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt; us into reproducing.

Schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental, but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within man's [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]], guaranteeing the quality of the human race:

{{quote|The ultimate aim of all love affairs ... is more important than all other aims in man's life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it. What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation'', Supplements to the Fourth Book]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has often been argued that Schopenhauer's thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the [[evolution|theory of evolution]], a claim met with satisfaction by [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] as he included a quote of the German philosopher in his ''[[Descent of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3ADescent_of_Man_1875.djvu/602|title=The Descent of Man|last=Darwin|first=Charles|page=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has also been noted about [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;"Nearly a century before Freud ... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body." Safranski p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political and social thought ===

==== Politics ====
[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]
Schopenhauer's politics were an echo of his system of ethics, which he elucidated in detail in his ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'' (the two essays ''On the Freedom of the Will'' and ''On the Basis of Morality'').

In occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state and state action to check our species' innate destructive tendencies. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

He declared that [[monarchy]] is "natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants, to cranes in flight, to wandering elephants, to wolves in a pack in search of prey, and to other animals."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. 2'', "On Jurisprudence and Politics," §127, trans. Payne (p. 254).&lt;/ref&gt; Intellect in monarchies, he writes, always has "much better chances against stupidity, its implacable and ever-present foe, than it has in republics; but this is a great advantage."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. 2'', "On Jurisprudence and Politics," §127, trans. Payne (p. 254).&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Schopenhauer disparaged [[republicanism]] as being "as unnatural to man as it is unfavorable to higher intellectual life and thus to the arts and sciences."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena, Vol. 2'', "On Jurisprudence and Politics," §127, trans. Payne (p. 255).&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he wrote proudly of how little attention he paid "to political affairs of [his] day".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did maintain his position of "minding not the times but the eternities".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, "For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Punishment ====
The State, Schopenhauer claimed, punishes criminals to prevent future crimes. It places "beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="twwr62"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, § 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again." Plato, "[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should "be an example to other men not to offend". Plato, "[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]", Book IX, 863.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]].

==== Races and religions ====
Schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern "white races" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus, whom he saw as equal):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilization and culture, apart from the [[History of Hinduism|ancient Hindus]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahmans]], the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], and the rulers of the [[South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. 2, "On Philosophy and Natural Science," §92, trans. Payne (p. 158-159).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer was fervently [[Abolitionism|anti-slavery]]. Speaking of the treatment of slaves in the [[Slavery in the United States|slave-holding states of the United States]], Schopenhauer condemned "those devils in human form, those bigoted, church-going, strict sabbath-observing scoundrels, especially the Anglican parsons among them" for how they "treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devil's claws." The slave-holding states of North America, Schopenhauer writes, are a "disgrace to the whole of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. 2, "On Ethics," §114, trans. Payne (p. 212).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love'', Schopenhauer wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; Further, the consideration as to the complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. Therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artandpopularculture.com/Metaphysik_der_Geschlechtsliebe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer also maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]]. Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual self-conquest. He saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly "Jewish" spirit:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Judaism] is, therefore, the crudest and poorest of all religions and consists merely in an absurd and revolting [[theism]]. It amounts to this that the [[Kyrios|''κύριος'' ['Lord']]], who has created the world, desires to be worshipped and adored; and so above all he is jealous, is envious of his colleagues, of all the other gods; if sacrifices are made to them he is furious and his Jews have a bad time ... It is most deplorable that this religion has become the basis of the prevailing religion of Europe; for it is a religion without any metaphysical tendency. While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.&lt;ref&gt;"Fragments for the History of Philosophy", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I, trans. Payne (p. 126).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Women ====
In his 1851 essay "On Women", Schopenhauer expressed opposition to what he called "Teutonico-Christian stupidity" of reflexive, unexamined reverence (''abgeschmackten Weiberveneration'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=Über die Weiber, §369}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the female. Schopenhauer wrote "Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted." He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed his opposition to [[monogamy]]. [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer "a misogynist without rival in ... Western philosophy". He claimed that "woman is by nature meant to obey". The essay does give some compliments, however: "women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.

Schopenhauer's writings influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''
PA Cain – Ga. L. Rev., 1989&lt;/ref&gt; His [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Young2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&amp;pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the elderly Schopenhauer sat for [[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|a sculpture portrait]] by the Prussian sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] in 1859, he was much impressed by the young woman's wit and independence, as well as by her skill as a visual artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Arthur Schopenhauer and Elisabet Ney|first=Sandra Salser|last=Long|journal=[[Southwest Review]]|volume=69|number=2|date=Spring 1984|pages=130–47|jstor=43469632}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his time with Ney, he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], "I have not yet spoken my last word about women. I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man."&lt;ref&gt;Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pederasty ====
In the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He wrote that pederasty has the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that "the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that "by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Heredity and eugenics ====
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]

Schopenhauer viewed personality and [[intellect]] as inherited. He quotes [[Horace]]'s saying, "From the brave and good are the brave descended" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', "Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;
Mechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his intellect through his mother, and personal character through the father.&lt;ref&gt;''On the Suffering of the World'' (1970), p. 35. Penguin Books – Great Ideas.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love – placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the "final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation. ... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake." This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E. F. J. Payne |volume=II | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | year = 1969 | isbn = 978-0-486-21762-8 |page=527 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another context, Schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis: "If you want Utopian plans, I would say: the only solution to the problem is the [[despotism]] of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy, a genuine nobility, achieved by [[mating]] the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women. This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic."&lt;ref&gt;''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts (e.g., [[Keith Ansell-Pearson]]) have suggested that Schopenhauer's anti-[[egalitarianism|egalitarianist]] sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.&lt;ref&gt;''Nietzsche and modern German thought'' by K. Ansell-Pearson – 1991 – Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal welfare ====
{{See also|Arthur Schopenhauer's views on Animal Rights|label 1=Arthur Schopenhauer's views on Animal Rights}}
As a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Gerhardt, "Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno." Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Puryear, [https://philpapers.org/rec/PURSOT "Schopenhauer on the Rights of Animals." ''European Journal of Philosophy'' 25/2 (2017):250-269].&lt;/ref&gt; For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word "will" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the essence of all external things and our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection. ''On the Will in Nature'', "Physiology and Pathology".&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.

{{quote|Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.|''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'', § 19}}
{{quote|Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.|''On the Basis of Morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.|''On the Basis of Morality'', chapter 8&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer went so far as to protest using the pronoun "it" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.&lt;ref&gt;"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like...." ''On the Basis of Morality'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot&lt;ref&gt;"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys." ''On the Basis of Morality'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt; and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.&lt;ref&gt;"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder." ''On the basis of morality'', § 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]&lt;ref&gt;"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights, ... in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable." ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.&lt;/ref&gt; belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: "Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours&amp;nbsp;..." This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''Ethics'', Appendix, 26, "whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions." ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual interests and affinities===

====[[Indology]]====
[[File:Schopenhauer 1852.jpg|thumb|Photo of Schopenhauer, 1852]]

Schopenhauer read the Latin translation of the [[Hindu texts|ancient Hindu texts]], the ''[[Upanishads]]'', translated by French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]]{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shukoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' ("The Great Secret"). He was so impressed by [[Indian philosophy|philosophy]] that he called it "the production of the highest human wisdom", and believed it contained superhuman concepts. Schopenhauer considered [[India]] as "the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom, the place from which [[Europeans]] could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways",{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} and regarded the ''Upanishads'' as "the most profitable and elevating reading which [...] is possible in the world. It has been the solace of my life, and will be the solace of my death."{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}}

Schopenhauer was first introduced to Anquetil du Perron's translation by Friedrich Majer in 1814.{{sfn|Clarke|1997|page=68}} They met during the winter of 1813–1814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother, according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Safranski maintains that, between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and they developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The view of things [...] that all plurality is only apparent, that in the endless series of individuals, passing simultaneously and successively into and out of life, generation after generation, age after age, there is but one and the same entity really existing, which is present and identical in all alike;—this theory, I say, was of course known long before Kant; indeed, it may be carried back to the remotest antiquity. It is the alpha and omega of the oldest book in the world, the sacred [[Vedas]], whose dogmatic part, or rather esoteric teaching, is found in the Upanishads. There, in almost every page this profound doctrine lies enshrined; with tireless repetition, in countless adaptations, by many varied parables and similes it is expounded and inculcated.|''On the Basis of Morality'', chapter 4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |year=1840 |publication-date=1908 |title=[[On the Basis of Morality]] |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/basisofmorality00schoiala#page/269/mode/2up |chapter=Part IV |translator-last=Bullock |translator-first=Arthur Brodrick |location=London |publisher=[[Swan Sonnenschein]] |pages=269–271 |via=[[Internet Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before going to bed. He called the opening up of [[Sanskrit literature]] "the greatest gift of our century", and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|access-date=9 May 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802010348/http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|archive-date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer's work, was the significance of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'', whose [[Mahāvākyas|Mahāvākya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]], is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 54–56&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Buddhism ====
Schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;Abelson, Peter (April 1993).
[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628204330/http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm |date=28 June 2011 }}. ''Philosophy East and West'' Volume 43, Number 2, pp. 255–278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[taṇhā]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four "truths of the Buddha" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', pp. 28&amp;nbsp;ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.&lt;ref name="David Burton 2004, page 22"&gt;David Burton, "Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study." Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Schopenhauer, will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; desire is prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puruṣārtha]] or goals of life in [[Vedānta]] [[Hinduism]].

In Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by:
* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or
* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.

However, Buddhist [[nirvāṇa]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the "extinguishing" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.&lt;ref&gt;John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer made the following statement in his discussion of religions:&lt;ref&gt;
"Schopenhauer is often said to be the first modern Western philosopher to attempt integration of his work with Eastern ways of thinking. That he was the first is true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence in broad terms between some central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will." (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14–15, 316–321). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&amp;nbsp;f.
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin – 2001 – University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Philosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga &amp; Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.&lt;ref&gt;''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses credence since he did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher McCoy, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.&lt;ref&gt;

''Journal of Buddhist Ethics'' Vol. 21 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magic and occultism====

Some traditions in [[Western esotericism]] and [[parapsychology]] interested Schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories. He praised [[animal magnetism]] as evidence for the reality of magic in his ''On the Will in Nature'', and went so far as to accept the division of magic into [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|left-hand and right-hand magic]], although he doubted the existence of demons.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 187–188 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer grounded magic in the Will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human Will, not on ritual. This theory notably parallels [[Aleister Crowley]]'s system of magick and its emphasis on human will.&lt;ref name="Myth of Disenchantment" /&gt; Given the importance of the Will to Schopenhauer's overarching system, this amounts to "suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer rejected the theory of [[disenchantment]] and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic, which he believed amount to "practical metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), pp. 188–189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neoplatonism]], including the traditions of [[Plotinus]] and to a lesser extent [[Marsilio Ficino]], has also been cited as an influence on Schopenhauer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson |first=Mark |title=Pure: Modernity, Philosophy, and the One |chapter=Experimental Subversions of Modernity |date=2009 |publisher=Sophia Perennis |isbn=978-1597310949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Schopenhauer had a wide range of interests, from science and opera to occultism and literature.

In his student years, Schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy. He kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death, and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library.&lt;ref name="Flute"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=meD1bGAjO6wC&amp;pg=PA30|title=Schopenhauer: a Biography|last=Cartwright|first=David E.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-82598-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|170}}

Many evenings were spent in the theatre, opera and ballet; Schopenhauer especially liked the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wagner and the Art of the Theatre|last=Carnegy|first=Patrick|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer considered music the highest art, and played the flute during his whole life.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

As a polyglot, he knew [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], English, [[Latin]] and [[ancient Greek]], and was an avid reader of poetry and literature. He particularly revered [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Petrarch]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with Kant in order to counterbalance him, so to speak, in the spirit of the age, the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction. But now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the German spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity.&lt;ref name="Flute" /&gt;{{rp|240}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In philosophy, his most important influences were, according to himself, Kant, [[Plato]] and the [[Upanishads]]. Concerning the Upanishads and [[Vedas]], he writes in ''The World as Will and Representation'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous centuries, if then the reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom, and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.&lt;ref&gt;''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Thoughts on other philosophers ==

=== Giordano Bruno and Spinoza ===
Schopenhauer saw [[Giordano Bruno|Bruno]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] as philosophers not bound to their age or nation. "Both were fulfilled by the thought, that as manifold the appearances of the world may be, it is still ''one'' being, that appears in all of them. ... Consequently, there is no place for God as creator of the world in their philosophy, but God is the world itself."&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|at=Vol. 1, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy. Note 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/arthur-schopenhauers-handschriftlicher-nachlass-vorlesungen-und-abhandlungen-4993/3|title=Handschriftlicher, Nachlass, Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen.|website=Gutenberg Spiegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer expressed regret that Spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of [[scholasticism]] and [[Cartesian philosophy]], and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of vague and overly broad definitions. Bruno on the other hand, who knew much about nature and ancient literature, presented his ideas with Italian vividness, and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near Plato's poetic and dramatic power of exposition.&lt;ref name="Spinoza and Bruno" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Presentation" /&gt;

Schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics, and it is therefore very remarkable that Spinoza called his main work ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]''. In fact, it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life-affirmation, if one completely ignores morality and self-denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Abschnitt: Handschriftlicher Nachlaß|at=§ 588|quote=Es kann daher eine vollkommen wahre Philosophie geben, die ganz von der Verneinung des Lebens abstrahirt, diese ganz ignorirt.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet even more remarkable that Schopenhauer mentions Spinoza as an example of the denial of the will, if one uses the French biography by Jean Maximilien Lucas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Vie_de_Spinoza|title=Vie de Spinoza - Wikisource|website=fr.wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the key to ''[[Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|at=§ 68|quote=We might to a certain extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction to his very insufficient essay, "De Emendatione Intellects", a passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means I know of stilling the storm of the passions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Schopenhauer's philosophy took Kant's work as its foundation. While he praised Kant's greatness, he nonetheless included a highly detailed criticism of Kantian philosophy as an appendix to ''The World as Will and Representation.'']]
{{See also|Critique of the Kantian philosophy|Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata}}
The importance of Kant for Schopenhauer, in philosophy as well as on a personal level, cannot be overstated. Kant's philosophy was the foundation of Schopenhauer's, and he had high praise for the [[Critique of Pure Reason#Transcendental Aesthetic|Transcendental Aesthetic]] section of Kant's ''Critique of Pure Reason.'' Schopenhauer maintained that Kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as Berkeley and [[Plato]], as Copernicus to [[Hicetas]], [[Philolaus]], and [[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]: Kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted.

Schopenhauer writes about Kant's influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'':
{{Quotation|I have already explained in the preface to the first edition, that my philosophy is founded on that of Kant, and therefore presupposes a thorough knowledge of it. I repeat this here. For Kant's teaching produces in the mind of everyone who has comprehended it a fundamental change which is so great that it may be regarded as an intellectual new-birth. It alone is able really to remove the inborn realism which proceeds from the original character of the intellect, which neither [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] nor [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]] succeed in doing, for they remain too much in the universal, while Kant goes into the particular, and indeed in a way that is quite unexampled both before and after him, and which has quite a peculiar, and, we might say, immediate effect upon the mind in consequence of which it undergoes a complete undeception, and forthwith looks at all things in another light. Only in this way can any one become susceptible to the more positive expositions which I have to give. On the other hand, he who has not mastered the Kantian philosophy, whatever else he may have studied, is, as it were, in a state of innocence; that is to say, he remains in the grasp of that natural and childish realism in which we are all born, and which fits us for everything possible, with the single exception of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World as Will and Representation|last=Arthur Schopenhauer|volume=Vol. 1, Preface of the Second Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his study room, one bust was of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the other was of Kant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schopenhauer. Pessimist and Pagan.|last=Jerauld McGill|first=Vivian|year=1931|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bond which Schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of Königsberg is demonstrated in an unfinished poem he dedicated to Kant (included in volume 2 of the ''Parerga''):

{{quotation|With my eyes I followed thee into the blue sky,&lt;br&gt;And there thy flight dissolved from view.&lt;br&gt;Alone I stayed in the crowd below,&lt;br&gt;Thy word and thy book my only solace.—&lt;br&gt;Through the strains of thy inspiring words&lt;br&gt;I sought to dispel the dreary solitude.&lt;br&gt;Strangers on all sides surround me.&lt;br&gt;The world is desolate and life interminable.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays, Volume 2'', trans. Payne, p. 655-656.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work, ''The World as Will and Representation'', to a detailed [[Critique of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]].

Schopenhauer praised Kant for his distinction between appearance and the [[thing-in-itself]], whereas the general consensus in [[German Idealism]] was that this was the weakest spot of Kant's theory,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|author1=David E. Cartwright |author2=Edward E. Erdmann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=xvi–xvii|quote=He had also rehearsed for the first time his physiological arguments for the intellectual nature of intuition [Anschauung, objective perception] in his On Vision and Colours, and he had discussed how his philosophy was corroborated by the sciences in On Will in Nature. ... Like the German Idealists, Schopenhauer was convinced that Kant’s great unknown, the thing in itself, is the weak point of the critical philosophy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to Kant, causality can find application on objects of experience only, and consequently, things-in-themselves cannot be the cause of appearances. The inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by Schopenhauer. He insisted that this was a true conclusion, drawn from false premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World as Will and Representation|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|volume=Vol. 1 Criticism of the Kantian philosophy|translator-last=J. Kemp|quote=With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the law of causality. Both doctrines are true, but their proof is false. They thus belong to the class of true conclusions from false premises.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Kantian school===
The leading figures of [[German idealism|post-Kantian philosophy]]—[[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|F. W. J. Schelling]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G. W. F. Hegel]]—were not respected by Schopenhauer. He argued that they were not philosophers at all, for they lacked "the first requirement of a philosopher, namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real," trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, they were merely sophists who, excelling in the art of beguiling the public, pursued their own selfish interests (such as professional advancement within the university system). Diatribes against the vacuity, dishonesty, pomposity, and self-interest of these contemporaries are to be found throughout Schopenhauer's published writings. The following passage is an example: 

{{Quotation|All this explains the painful impression with which we are seized when, after studying genuine thinkers, we come to the writings of Fichte and Schelling, or even to the presumptuously scribbled nonsense of Hegel, produced as it was with a boundless, though justified, confidence in German stupidity. With those genuine thinkers one always found an ''honest'' investigation of truth and just as ''honest'' an attempt to communicate their ideas to others. Therefore whoever reads Kant, Locke, Hume, Malebranche, Spinoza, and Descartes feels elevated and agreeably impressed. This is produced through communion with a noble mind which has and awakens ideas and which thinks and sets one thinking. The reverse of all this takes place when we read the above-mentioned three German sophists. An unbiased reader, opening one of their books and then asking himself whether this is the tone of a thinker wanting to instruct or that of a charlatan wanting to impress, cannot be five minutes in any doubt; here everything breathes so much of ''dishonesty''.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena,'' Vol. 1, Appendix to "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real," trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schopenhauer deemed Schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his "elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of Kant" concerning the intelligible character, if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting Kant, instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Freedom of the Will|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for Hegel, whom he considered less worthy than Fichte or Schelling. Whereas Fichte was merely a windbag (''Windbeutel''), Hegel was a "commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive, and ignorant charlatan."&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Vol. I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy", Sec. 13, trans. E. J. Payne (Oxford, 1974), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophers [[Karl Popper]] and [[Mario Bunge]] agreed with this distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Open Society and Her Enemies|journal=Nature|volume=157|issue=3987|last=Popper|first=Karl|year=1946|page=52|bibcode=1946Natur.157..387R|doi=10.1038/157387a0|s2cid=4074331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge1"&gt;{{cite web | authors = Bunge, Mario | year = 2020 | title = Mario Bunge nos dijo: "Se puede ignorar la filosofía, pero no evitarla" | url = https://www.filco.es/mario-bunge-no-evitar-filosofia/ | publisher = Filosofía&amp;Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel, Schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his ''Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,'' not only "performed no service to philosophy, but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy, and thereby on German literature in general, really a downright stupefying, or we could even say a pestilential influence, which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;''The Two Fundamental Problems of Ethics,'' Preface to the First Edition, trans.

==Influence==
[[File:Arthur_Schopenhauer_by_Elisabet_Ney.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Schopenhauer (sculpture)|Sculpture of Schopenhauer]] by [[Elisabeth Ney]]]]
Schopenhauer remained the most influential German philosopher until the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name=Weltschmerz&gt;{{Cite book|title=Weltschmerz, Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860–1900|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0198768715|location=Oxford|pages=14–16|quote=Arthur Schopenhauer was the most famous and influential philosopher in Germany from 1860 until the First World War. ...

Schopenhauer set the agenda for his age.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers including [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Paul Deussen]], Lazar von Hellenbach, [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], Ernst Otto Lindner, [[Philipp Mainländer]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Olga Plümacher]] and [[Agnes Taubert]]. His legacy shaped the intellectual debate, and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him, [[neo-Kantianism]] and [[positivism]], to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored, and in doing so he changed them markedly.&lt;ref name="Weltschmerz" /&gt; The French writer [[Maupassant]] commented that "to-day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought."&lt;ref&gt;Beside Schopenhauer's Corpse&lt;/ref&gt; Other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include [[Hans Vaihinger]], [[Johannes Volkelt|Volkelt]], [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Solovyov]] and [[Otto Weininger|Weininger]].

Schopenhauer was well read by physicists, most notably Einstein, [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], [[Wolfgang Pauli]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997|quote=Pauli greatly admired Schopenhauer. ... Pauli wrote sympathetically about extrasensory perception, noting approvingly that "even such a thoroughly critical philosopher as Schopenhauer not only regarded parapsychological effects going far beyond what is secured by scientific evidence as possible, but even considered them as a support for his philosophy".}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ettore Majorana|Majorana]].&lt;ref name=Majorana /&gt; Einstein described Schopenhauer's thoughts as a "continual consolation" and called him a genius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein: His Life and Universe|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2007|isbn=978-0743264747|location=New York|page=367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Berlin study three figures hung on the wall: [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]], [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], Schopenhauer.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|87}} [[Konrad Wachsmann]] recalled: "He often sat with one of the well-worn Schopenhauer volumes, and as he sat there, he seemed so pleased, as if he were engaged with a serene and cheerful work."&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Peek behind the Veil of Maya: Einstein, Schopenhauer, and the Historical Background of the Conception of Space as a Ground for the Individuation of Physical Systems|last=Don|first=Howard|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}

When [[Erwin Schrödinger]] discovered Schopenhauer ("the greatest savant of the West") he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Einstein's Dice and Schrödinger's Cat: How Two Great Minds Battled Quantum Randomness to Create a Unified Theory of Physics|last=Halpern|first=Paul|year=2015|isbn=978-0465040650|page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Howard" /&gt;{{rp|132}} [[Wolfgang Pauli]] accepted the main tenet of Schopenhauer's metaphysics, that the [[thing-in-itself]] is will.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6149849|title=Schopenhauers Metaphysics and Contemporary Quantum Theory|last=Raymond B.

But most of all Schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists. [[Richard Wagner]] became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the Schopenhauerian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Magee (2000) 276–278.&lt;/ref&gt; The admiration was not mutual, and Schopenhauer proclaimed: "I remain faithful to Rossini and Mozart!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invention of Beethoven and Rossini: Historiography, Analysis, Criticism|last=Nicholas Mathew, Benjamin Walton|page=296}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So he has been [[philosopher nicknames|nickname]]d "the artist's philosopher".&lt;ref name=iep/&gt; See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].

Under the influence of Schopenhauer, [[Leo Tolstoy]] became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self-renunciation. When he read Schopenhauer's, philosophy Tolstoy exclaimed "at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. ... It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection."&lt;ref&gt;Tolstoy's letter to Afanasy Fet on 30 August 1869. "Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights as I've never experienced before. I have brought all of his works and read him over and over, Kant too by the way. Assuredly no student has ever learned and discovered so much in one semester as I have during this summer. I do not know if I shall ever change my opinion, but at present I am convinced that Schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men. You say he is so-so, he has written a few things on philosophy? What is so-so? It is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection. I have started to translate him. Won't you help me? Indeed, I cannot understand how his name can be unknown. The only explanation for this can only be the one he so often repeats, that is, that there is scarcely anyone but idiots in the world."&lt;/ref&gt; He said that what he has written in ''[[War and Peace]]'' is also said by Schopenhauer in ''The World as Will and Representation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/316432|title=Quietism from the Side of Happiness: Tolstoy, Schopenhauer, War and Peace|last=Thompson|first=Caleb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}

Scholar Brian Yothers notes that Melville "marked numerous misanthropic and even suicidal remarks, suggesting an attraction to the most extreme sorts of solitude, but he also made note of Schopenhauer's reflection on the moral ambiguities of genius."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yothers |first1=Brian |title=Sacred Uncertainty: Religious Difference and The Shape of Melville's Career |date=2015 |publisher=Northwestern University Press |location=Evanston, Illinois |isbn=978-0-8101-3071-5 |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer's attraction to and discussions of both Eastern and Western religions in conjunction with each other made an impression on Melville in his final years.

[[Sergei Prokofiev]], although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism, became fascinated with Schopenhauer after reading ''Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life'' in ''Parerga and Paralipomena.'' "With his truths Schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sergey Prokofiev and His World|last=Morrison|first=Simon|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780691138954|pages=19, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay "Schopenhauer als Erzieher"&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]&lt;/ref&gt; one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.

Early in his career, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism, and some traits of Schopenhauer's influence (particularly Schopenhauerian trancendentalism) can be observed in the [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Glock, Hans-Johann | year = 2017 | title = A Companion to Wittgenstein | page = https://books.google.es/books?id=WbfBDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=wittgenstein+epistemological+idealism+tractatus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hjb4-Wzjei&amp;sig=ACfU3U3X71hnvzg7d34iCswxBLsc1dM_NQ&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiR5c2g99LpAhXLxoUKHdPAB3oQ6AEwA3oECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=wittgenstein%20epistemological%20idealism%20tractatus&amp;f=false p. 60 | location = Sussex, UK | publisher = Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Glock, Hans-Johann | year = 2000 | title = The Cambridge Companion to Schopenhauer | page = https://books.google.es/books?id=PnUF-UjhX_oC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=Schopenhauer%27s+all+pervasive+influence+on+Wittgenstein&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiB36uq7NLpAhXBxoUKHdniAsYQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Schopenhauer's%20all%20pervasive%20influence%20on%20Wittgenstein&amp;f=false p. 424 | location = New York, NY | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, later on, Wittgenstein rejected epistemological [[transcendental idealism]] for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual [[Metaphysical realism|realism]]. In later years, Wittgenstein became highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker.&lt;ref name="Culture &amp; Value, p.24, 1933–4"&gt;Culture &amp; Value, p. 24, 1933–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Norman. Ludwig Wittgenstein: A Memoir. Oxford University Press, 1958, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; His friend [[Bertrand Russell]] had a low opinion on the philosopher, and even came to attack him in his [[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|''History of Western Philosophy'']] for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=History of Western Philosophy|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|page=786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposite to Russell on the foundations of mathematics, the Dutch mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]] incorporated Kant's and Schopenhauer's ideas in the philosophical school of [[intuitionism]], where mathematics is considered as a purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed. Brouwer was also influenced by Schopenhauer's metaphysics, and wrote an essay on mysticism.

Schopenhauer's philosophy has made its way into a novel [[The Schopenhauer Cure]] written by an American existential psychiatrist and emeritus professor of psychiatry [[Irvin Yalom]].

'''Albert Speer''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|p|ɛər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈʃpeːɐ̯|lang|De-Albert Speer.ogg|lang}}; March 19, 1905&amp;nbsp;– September 1, 1981)  served as the [[Reich Ministry of Armaments and War Production|Minister of Armaments and War Production]] in [[Nazi Germany]] during most of [[World War II]]. A close ally of [[Adolf Hitler]], he was convicted at the [[Nuremberg trials]] and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

An architect by training, Speer joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1931. His architectural skills made him increasingly prominent within the Party, and he became a member of Hitler's inner circle. Hitler instructed him to design and construct structures including the [[Reich Chancellery]] and the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]]. In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for Berlin. In this capacity he was responsible for the Central Department for Resettlement that [[Nazi persecution of Jews|evicted Jewish tenants]] from their homes in Berlin. In February 1942, Speer was appointed as [[Reich Minister of Armaments and War Production]]. Using misleading statistics, he promoted himself as having performed an "armaments miracle" that was widely credited with keeping Germany in the war.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=174-75}} In 1944, Speer established a [[Jägerstab|task force]] to increase production of fighter aircraft. It became instrumental in the exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] for the benefit of the German war effort.

After the war, Speer was among the 24 "major [[List of Axis personnel indicted for war crimes|war criminals]]" arrested and charged with the crimes of the Nazi regime at the Nuremberg trials. He was found guilty of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]], principally for the use of slave labor, narrowly avoiding a death sentence. Having served his full term, Speer was released in 1966. He used his writings from the time of imprisonment as the basis for two autobiographical books, ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]''. Speer's books were a success; the public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich. Speer died of a [[stroke]] in 1981. Little remains of his personal architectural work.

Through his autobiographies and interviews, Speer carefully constructed an image of himself as a man who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich. He continued to deny explicit knowledge of, and responsibility for, [[the Holocaust]]. This image dominated his [[historiography]] in the decades following the war, giving rise to the "Speer Myth": the perception of him as an [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] [[Technocracy|technocrat]] responsible for revolutionizing the German war machine. The myth began to fall apart in the 1980s, when the armaments miracle was attributed to [[Propaganda in Nazi Germany|Nazi propaganda]]. [[Adam Tooze]] wrote in ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'' that the idea that Speer was an apolitical technocrat was "absurd". [[Martin Kitchen]], writing in ''[[Speer: Hitler's Architect]]'', stated that much of the increase in Germany's arms production was actually due to systems instituted by Speer's predecessor ([[Fritz Todt]]) and furthermore that Speer was intimately involved in the "[[Final Solution]]".

==Early years and personal life==
Speer was born in [[Mannheim]], into an upper-middle-class family. He was the second of three sons of Luise Máthilde Wilhelmine (Hommel) and [[Albert Friedrich Speer]].{{sfn|Schubert|2006|p=5}} In 1918, the family leased their Mannheim residence and moved to a home they had in Heidelberg.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=15}} [[Henry T. King]], deputy prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials]] who later wrote a book about Speer said, "Love and warmth were lacking in the household of Speer's youth."{{sfn|King|1997|p=27}} His brothers, Ernst and Hermann, bullied him throughout his childhood.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}} Speer was active in sports, taking up skiing and mountaineering.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=23}} He followed in the footsteps of his father and grandfather and studied architecture.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=11–13}}

Speer began his architectural studies at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] instead of a more highly acclaimed institution because the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] crisis of 1923 limited his parents' income.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=17–18}} In 1924 when the crisis had abated, he transferred to the "much more reputable" [[Technical University of Munich]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=63}} In 1925 he transferred again, this time to the [[Technical University of Berlin]] where he studied under [[Heinrich Tessenow]], whom Speer greatly admired.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=18–19}} After passing his exams in 1927, Speer became Tessenow's assistant, a high honor for a man of 22.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=34–36}} As such, Speer taught some of his classes while continuing his own postgraduate studies.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=71–73}} In Munich Speer began a close friendship, ultimately spanning over 50 years, with [[Rudolf Wolters]], who also studied under Tessenow.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=33–34}}

In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the daughter of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years elapsed before Margarete was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=47–49}} The couple would have six children together, but Albert Speer grew increasingly distant from his family after 1933. He remained so even after his release from imprisonment in 1966, despite their efforts to forge closer bonds.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–328}}
==Party architect and government functionary==
===Joining the Nazis (1931–1934)===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-V00555-3, Obersalzberg, Albert Speer, Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Speer shows Hitler a project at [[Obersalzberg]].]]

In January 1931, Speer applied for [[Nazi Party]] membership, and on March 1, 1931, he became member number 474,481.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=24}} &lt;ref&gt;On 31 January 1931 He also joined the Motor Unit of the SA being a member until autumn 1932. On 20 July 1942 Speer was enrolled by order of Heinrich Himmler as a SS Man/member of Personal Staff of the SS Reichsfurher [SS Number 46104]. However his application was never completed, becoming ''[[nolle prosequi]]''. [Nazi conspiracy and aggresion vol. VI pp. 256 Document 3568-PS]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, with stipends shrinking amid [[the Depression]], Speer surrendered his position as Tessenow's assistant and moved to Mannheim, hoping to make a living as an architect. After he failed to do so, his father gave him a part-time job as manager of his properties. In July&amp;nbsp;1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party before the ''[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]'' [[Weimar republic#Elections of July 1932|elections]]. While they were there his friend, Nazi Party official [[Karl Hanke]] recommended the young architect to [[Joseph Goebbels]] to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler [[Machtergreifung|took office]] in January&amp;nbsp;1933.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=25–26}}

The organizers of the 1933 [[Nuremberg Rally]] asked Speer to submit designs for the rally, bringing him into contact with Hitler for the first time. Neither the organizers nor [[Rudolf Hess]] were willing to decide whether to approve the plans, and Hess sent Speer to Hitler's Munich apartment to seek his approval.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=100–101}} This work won Speer his first national post, as Nazi Party "Commissioner for the Artistic and Technical Presentation of Party Rallies and Demonstrations".{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=49}}

Shortly after Hitler came into power, he began to make plans to rebuild the chancellery. At the end of 1933, he contracted [[Paul Troost]] to renovate the entire building. Hitler appointed Speer, whose work for Goebbels had impressed him, to manage the building site for Troost.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=41}} As Chancellor, Hitler had a residence in the building and came by every day to be briefed by Speer and the building supervisor on the progress of the renovations. After one of these briefings, Hitler invited Speer to lunch, to the architect's great excitement.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=101–03}} Speer quickly became part of Hitler's inner circle; he was expected to call on him in the morning for a walk or chat, to provide consultation on architectural matters, and to discuss Hitler's ideas. Most days he was invited to dinner.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=106}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=41–42}}

In the English version of his memoirs, Speer says that his political commitment merely consisted of paying his "monthly dues". He assumed his German readers would not be so gullible and told them the Nazi Party offered a "new mission". He was more forthright in an interview with William Hamsher in which he said he joined the party in order to save "Germany from Communism". After the war, he claimed to have had little interest in politics at all and had joined almost by chance. Like many of those in power in the Third Reich, he was not an ideologue, "nor was he anything more than an instinctive anti-Semite."{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=24}} The historian [[Magnus Brechtken]], discussing Speer, said he did not give anti-Jewish public speeches and that his [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] can best be understood through his actions—which were anti-Semitic.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}} Brechtken added that, throughout Speer's life, his central motives were to gain power, rule, and acquire wealth.{{sfn|Brechtken|2017|p=45}}

When Troost died on January 21, 1934, Speer effectively replaced him as the Party's chief architect. Hitler appointed Speer as head of the Chief Office for Construction, which placed him nominally on Hess's staff.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=60}}

One of Speer's first commissions after Troost's death was the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in [[Nuremberg]]. It was used for [[Nazi party rally grounds|Nazi propaganda rallies]] and can be seen in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s propaganda film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. The building was able to hold 340,000 people.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=59}} Speer insisted that as many events as possible be held at night, both to give greater prominence to his lighting effects and to hide the overweight Nazis.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=131}} Nuremberg was the site of many official Nazi buildings. Many more buildings were planned. If built, the [[Deutsches Stadion|German Stadium]] would have accommodated 400,000 spectators.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=59}} Speer modified [[Werner March]]'s design for the [[Olympiastadion (Berlin)#1936–1945: Olympiastadion|Olympic Stadium]] being built for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]. He added a stone exterior that pleased Hitler.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=65}} Speer designed the German Pavilion for the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|1937 international exposition in Paris]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=60}}

===Berlin's General Building Inspector (1937–1942)===
[[File:Welthauptstadt germania 11.jpg|thumb|right|Model of the Große Halle (also called Ruhmeshalle or Volkshalle) with the [[Reichstag building]] and the [[Brandenburg Gate]]]]

In 1937, Hitler appointed Speer as General Building Inspector for the Reich Capital. This carried with it the rank of undersecretary of state in the Reich government and gave him extraordinary powers over the Berlin city government.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=64}} It also made Speer a member of the ''Reichstag'', though the body by then [[Enabling Act of 1933|had little effective power]].{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=144}} Hitler ordered Speer to develop plans to [[Germania (city)|rebuild Berlin]]. These centered on a three-mile-long grand boulevard running from north to south, which Speer called the ''Prachtstrasse'', or Street of Magnificence;{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=140}} he also referred to it as the "North–South Axis".{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=141}} At the northern end of the boulevard, Speer planned to build the ''[[Volkshalle]]'', a huge domed assembly hall over {{convert|700|ft|m|-1}} high, with floor space for 180,000 people. At the southern end of the avenue, a great triumphal arch, almost {{convert|400|ft|m|-1}} high and able to fit the [[Arc de Triomphe]] inside its opening, was planned. The existing Berlin railroad termini were to be dismantled, and two large new stations built.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=65–70}} Speer hired Wolters as part of his design team, with special responsibility for the ''Prachtstrasse''.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=27}} The outbreak of World War II in 1939 led to the postponement, and later the abandonment, of these plans.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=71}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146III-373, Modell der Neugestaltung Berlins ("Germania").jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Volkshalle's Great Dome can be seen at the top of this model of Hitler's plan for Berlin.]]

Plans to build a new Reich chancellery had been underway since 1934. Land had been purchased by the end of 1934 and starting in March 1936 the first buildings were demolished to create space at [[Voßstraße]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46–47}} Speer was involved virtually from the beginning. In the aftermath of the [[Night of the Long Knives]], he had been commissioned to renovate the [[Borsig Palace]] on the corner of Voßstraße and [[Wilhelmstraße]] as headquarters of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA).{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=45}} He completed the preliminary work for the new chancellery by May 1936. In June 1936 he charged a personal honorarium of 30,000 Reichsmark and estimated the chancellery would be completed within three to four years. Detailed plans were completed in July 1937 and the first shell of the new chancellery was complete on January 1, 1938. On January 27, 1938, Speer received plenipotentiary powers from Hitler to finish the new chancellery by January 1, 1939. For propaganda Hitler claimed during the topping-out ceremony on August 2, 1938, that he had ordered Speer to complete the new chancellery that year.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=46–49}} Shortages of labor meant the construction workers had to work in ten-to-twelve-hour shifts.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}} The ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) built two concentration camps in 1938 and used the inmates to quarry stone for its construction. A brick factory was built near the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]] at Speer's behest; when someone commented on the poor conditions there, Speer stated, "The Yids got used to making bricks while in Egyptian captivity".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=72}} The chancellery was completed in early January 1939.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}} The building itself was hailed by Hitler as the "crowning glory of the greater German political empire".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=53–56}}

[[File:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|Hitler in Paris in 1940 with Speer (left) and sculptor [[Arno Breker]]]]
During the Chancellery project, the [[pogrom]] of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' took place. Speer made no mention of it in the first draft of ''Inside the Third Reich''. It was only on the urgent advice of his publisher that he added a mention of seeing the ruins of the Central Synagogue in Berlin from his car.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=164}} ''Kristallnacht'' accelerated Speer's ongoing efforts to dispossess Berlin's Jews from their homes. From 1939 on, Speer's Department used the [[Nuremberg Laws]] to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=116}} Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=120}} Speer denied he knew they were being put on [[Holocaust trains]] and claimed that those displaced were, "Completely free and their families were still in their apartments".{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=189}} He also said: "&amp;nbsp;... en route to my ministry on the city highway, I could see&amp;nbsp;... crowds of people on the platform of nearby Nikolassee Railroad Station. I knew that these must be Berlin Jews who were being evacuated. I am sure that an oppressive feeling struck me as I drove past. I presumably had a sense of somber events."{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=189}} [[Matthias Schmidt]] said Speer had personally inspected [[concentration camps]] and described his comments as an "outright farce".{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=190}} Martin Kitchen described Speer's often repeated line that he knew nothing of the "dreadful things" as hollow—because not only was he fully aware of the fate of the Jews he was actively participating in their persecution.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=322}}

As Germany started World War II in Europe, Speer instituted quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=115}} Speer used forced Jewish labor on these projects, in addition to regular German workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=78}} Construction stopped on the Berlin and Nüremberg plans at the outbreak of war. Though stockpiling of materials and other work continued, this slowed to a halt as more resources were needed for the armament industry.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=39–40}} Speer's offices undertook building work for each branch of the military, and for the SS, using slave labor.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=78}} Speer's building work made him among the wealthiest of the Nazi elite.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=75–76}}

==Minister of Armaments==
===Appointment and increasing power===
[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16636, Nordeuropa, Eduard Dietl, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Speer (wearing [[Organisation Todt]] armband) and ''Wehrmacht'' general [[Eduard Dietl]] at [[Rovaniemi Airport]] in Finland, December 1943]]

On February 8, 1942, Minister of Armaments [[Fritz Todt]] died in a plane crash shortly after taking off from Hitler's [[Wolf's Lair|eastern headquarters]] at [[Kętrzyn|Rastenburg]]. Speer arrived there the previous evening and accepted Todt's offer to fly with him to Berlin. Speer cancelled some hours before take-off because the previous night he had been up late in a meeting with Hitler.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=117–118}} Hitler appointed Speer in Todt's place. [[Martin Kitchen]], a British historian, says that the choice was not surprising. Speer was loyal to Hitler, and his experience building prisoner of war camps and other structures for the military qualified him for the job.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=120–121}} Hitler also appointed Speer as head of the [[Organisation Todt]], a massive, government-controlled construction company.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=6}} Characteristically Hitler did not give Speer any clear remit; he was left to fight his contemporaries in the regime for power and control. As an example, he wanted to be given power over all armaments issues under [[Hermann Göring]]'s [[Four Year Plan]]. Göring was reluctant to grant this. However Speer secured Hitler's support, and on March 1, 1942, Göring signed a decree naming Speer "General Plenipotentiary for Armament Tasks" in the Four Year Plan.{{sfn|Carroll|2018|p=234}} Speer proved to be ambitious, unrelenting and ruthless.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} Speer set out to gain control not just of armaments production in the army, but in the whole armed forces.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=122}} It did not immediately dawn on his political rivals that his calls for rationalization and reorganization were hiding his desire to sideline them and take control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=148–149}}

Speer was fêted at the time, and in the post-war era, for performing an "armaments miracle" in which German war production dramatically increased. This "miracle" was brought to a halt in the summer of 1943 by, among other factors, the [[Battle of the Ruhr|first]] sustained [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=597–598}} Other factors probably contributed to the increase more than Speer himself. Germany's armaments production had already begun to result in increases under his predecessor, Todt. Naval armaments were not under Speer's supervision until October 1943, nor the Luftwaffe's armaments until June of the following year. Yet each showed comparable increases in production despite not being under Speer's control.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=368–370}} Another factor that produced the boom in ammunition was the policy of allocating more coal to the steel industry.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=575–576}} Production of every type of weapon peaked in June and July 1944, but there was now a severe shortage of fuel. After August 1944, oil from the Romanian fields was no longer available. Oil production became so low that any possibility of offensive action became impossible and weaponry lay idle.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=232–233}}

As Minister of Armaments, Speer was responsible for supplying weapons to the army.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=127}} With Hitler's full agreement, he decided to prioritize tank production, and he was given unrivalled power to ensure success.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=145–147}} Hitler was closely involved with the design of the tanks, but kept changing his mind about the specifications. This delayed the program, and Speer was unable to remedy the situation. In consequence, despite tank production having the highest priority, relatively little of the armaments budget was spent on it. This led to a significant German Army failure at the [[Battle of Prokhorovka]], a major turning point on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] against the Soviet [[Red Army]].{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=147–148}}

As head of Organisation Todt, Speer was directly involved in the construction and alteration of concentration camps. He agreed to expand [[Auschwitz]] and some other camps, allocating 13.7 million Reichsmarks for the work to be carried out. This allowed an extra 300 huts to be built at Auschwitz, increasing the total human capacity to 132,000. Included in the building works was material to build [[Nazi gas chamber|gas chambers]], crematoria and morgues. The SS called this "Professor Speer's Special Programme".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=156}}

Speer realized that with six million workers drafted into the armed forces, there was a labor shortage in the war economy, and not enough workers for his factories. In response, Hitler appointed [[Fritz Sauckel]] as a "manpower dictator" to obtain new workers.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=150}} Speer and Sauckel cooperated closely to meet Speer's labor demands.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=151–152}} Hitler gave Sauckel a free hand to obtain labor, something that delighted Speer, who had requested 1,000,000 "voluntary" laborers to meet the need for armament workers. Sauckel had whole villages in France, Holland and Belgium forcibly rounded up and shipped to Speer's factories.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=159}} Sauckel obtained new workers often using the most brutal methods.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=146–150}} In occupied areas of the Soviet Union, that had been subject to partisan action, civilian men and women were rounded up en masse and sent to work forcibly in Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=165–166}} By April 1943, Sauckel had supplied 1,568,801 "voluntary" laborers, forced laborers, prisoners of war and concentration camp prisoners to Speer for use in his armaments factories. It was for the maltreatment of these people, that Speer was principally convicted at the Nuremberg Trials.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=160}}

===Consolidation of arms production===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28426, A. Speer, E. Milch, W. Messerschmitt.jpg|thumb|Speer with Luftwaffe field marshal [[Erhard Milch]] and aircraft designer [[Willy Messerschmitt]], May 1944]]
Following his appointment as Minister of Armaments, Speer was in control of armaments production solely for the [[German Army (1935–1945)|Army]]. He coveted control of the production of armaments for the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' and ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as well. He set about extending his power and influence with unexpected ambition.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}} His close relationship with Hitler provided him with political protection, and he was able to outwit and outmanoeuver his rivals in the regime. Hitler's cabinet was dismayed at his tactics, but, regardless, he was able to accumulate new responsibilities and more power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}} By July 1943, he had gained control of armaments production for the ''Luftwaffe'' and ''Kriegsmarine''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=167–169}} In August 1943, he took control of most of the Ministry of Economics, to become, in [[Admiral Dönitz]]'s words, "Europe's economic dictator". His formal title was changed on September 2, 1943 to "Reich Minister for Armaments and War Production". He had become one of the most powerful people in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=7–8}}

Speer and his hand-picked director of submarine construction [[Otto Merker]] believed that the shipbuilding industry was being held back by outdated methods, and revolutionary new approaches imposed by outsiders would dramatically improve output.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=614}} This belief proved incorrect, and Speer and Merker's attempt to build the ''Kriegsmarine''{{'}}s new generation of submarines, the [[Type XXI submarine|Type XXI]] and [[Type XXIII submarine|Type XXIII]], as [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] sections at different facilities rather than at single dockyards contributed to the failure of this strategically important program. The designs were rushed into production, and the completed submarines were crippled by flaws which resulted from the way they had been constructed. While dozens of submarines were built, few ever entered service.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=616–618}}

In December 1943, Speer visited Organisation Todt workers in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], while there he seriously damaged his knee and was incapacitated for several months.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8–9}} He was under the dubious care of Professor [[Karl Gebhardt]] at a medical clinic called Hohenlychen where patients "mysteriously failed to survive".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=188}} In mid-January 1944, Speer had a lung embolism and fell seriously ill. Concerned about retaining power, he did not appoint a deputy and continued to direct work of the Armaments Ministry from his bedside. Speer's illness coincided with the Allied "[[Big Week]]", a series of bombing raids on the German aircraft factories that were a devastating blow to aircraft production.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=188–189}} His political rivals used the opportunity to undermine his authority and damage his reputation with Hitler. He lost Hitler's unconditional support and began to lose power.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=8–9}}

In response to the Allied Big Week, [[Adolf Hitler]] authorized the creation of a [[Jägerstab|Fighter Staff committee]]. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the March 1, 1944, orders of Speer, with support from [[Erhard Milch]] of the Reich Aviation Ministry.{{sfn|Boog et al|p=347|2006}} Production of German fighter aircraft more than doubled between 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Overy|2002|p=343}} The growth, however, consisted in large part of models that were becoming obsolescent and proved easy prey for Allied aircraft.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=582–584}} On August 1, 1944, Speer merged the Fighter Staff into a newly formed [[Rüstungsstab|Armament Staff committee]].{{sfn|Uziel|2012|p=82}}

[[File:Überlebende KZ Mühldorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Survivors of the [[Mühldorf concentration camp complex|Mühldorf concentration camp]] upon liberation in 1945. Mühldorf supplied slave workers for the [[Weingut I]] project.]]

The Fighter Staff committee was instrumental in bringing about the increased exploitation of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]] in the war economy.{{sfn|Buggeln|p=45|2014}} The SS provided 64,000 prisoners for 20 separate projects from various concentration camps including [[Mittelbau-Dora]]. Prisoners worked for [[Junkers]], [[Messerschmitt]], [[Henschel &amp; Son|Henschel]] and [[BMW#1939–1945: World War II|BMW]], among others.{{sfn|Buggeln|pp=46–48|2014}} To increase production, Speer introduced a system of punishments for his workforce. Those who feigned illness, slacked off, sabotaged production or tried to escape were denied food or sent to concentration camps. In 1944 this became endemic; over half a million workers were arrested.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=215}} By this time, 140,000 people were working in Speer's underground factories. These factories were death-traps; discipline was brutal, with regular executions. There were so many corpses at the Dora underground factory, for example, that the crematorium was overwhelmed. Speer's own staff described the conditions there as "hell".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}

The largest technological advance under Speer's command came through the rocket program. It began in 1932 but had not supplied any weaponry. Speer enthusiastically supported the program and in March 1942 made an order for A4 rockets, the predecessor of the world's first ballistic missile, the [[V-2 rocket]]. The rockets were researched at a facility in [[Peenemünde]] along with the [[V-1 flying bomb]]. The V-2's first target was Paris on September 8, 1944. The program while advanced proved to be an impediment to the war economy. The large capital investment was not repaid in military effectiveness.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=216}} The rockets were built at an underground factory at [[Mittelwerk]]. Labor to build the A4 rockets came from the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp. Of the 60,000 people who ended up at the camp 20,000 died, due to the appalling conditions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=221}}

By the summer of 1944 Speer had lost control of Organisation Todt and armaments.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}} He opposed the [[20 July plot|assassination attempt against Hitler]] on July 20, 1944. He was not involved in the plot, and played a minor role in the regime's efforts to regain control over Berlin after Hitler survived.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=204–205}} After the plot Speer's rivals attacked some of his closest allies and his management system fell out of favor with radicals in the party. He lost yet more authority.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=8}}

===Defeat of Nazi Germany===

Losses of territory and a dramatic expansion of the Allied strategic bombing campaign caused the collapse of the German economy from late 1944. Air attacks on the transport network were particularly effective, as they cut the main centres of production off from essential coal supplies.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=648–651}} In January 1945, Speer told Goebbels that armaments production could be sustained for at least a year.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=652}} However, he concluded that the war was lost after Soviet forces captured the important [[Silesia]]n industrial region later that month.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=259}} Nevertheless, Speer believed that Germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the Allies than the [[unconditional surrender]] they insisted upon.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} During January and February, Speer claimed that his ministry would deliver "decisive weapons" and a large increase in armaments production which would "bring about a dramatic change on the battlefield".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=254}} Speer gained control over the railways in February, and asked Himmler to supply concentration camp prisoners to work on their repair.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=261–262}}

By mid-March, Speer had accepted that Germany's economy would collapse within the next eight weeks. While he sought to frustrate directives to destroy industrial facilities in areas at risk of capture, so that they could be used after the war, he still supported the war's continuation. Speer provided Hitler with a memorandum on March 15, which detailed Germany's dire economic situation and sought approval to cease demolitions of infrastructure. Three days later, he also proposed to Hitler that Germany's remaining military resources be concentrated along the [[Rhine]] and [[Vistula]] rivers in an attempt to prolong the fighting. This ignored military realities, as the German armed forces were unable to match the Allies' firepower and were facing total defeat.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=652–653}}{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=262–263}} Hitler rejected Speer's proposal to cease demolitions. Instead, he issued the "[[Nero Decree]]" on March 19, which called for the destruction of all infrastructure as the army retreated. Speer was appalled by this order, and persuaded several key military and political leaders to ignore it.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=265–267}} During a meeting with Speer on March 28/29, Hitler rescinded the decree and gave him authority over demolitions.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=269–270}} Speer ended them, though the army continued to blow up bridges.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=291}}{{efn|For a treatise on this aspect of the war including Speer's involvement see: Randall, Hansen, ''Disobeying Hitler: German Resistance in the Last Year of WWII'', Faber &amp; Faber, 2014, 1st edition, {{ISBN|978-0-571-28451-1}}.}}

By April, little was left of the armaments industry, and Speer had few official duties.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=275}} Speer visited the ''[[Führerbunker]]'' on April 22 for the last time. He met Hitler and toured the damaged Chancellery before leaving Berlin to return to Hamburg.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=263–270}} On April 29, the day before committing suicide, Hitler dictated a [[Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler|final political testament]] which dropped Speer from the successor government. Speer was to be replaced by his subordinate, [[Karl Saur|Karl-Otto Saur]].{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=234}} Speer was disappointed that Hitler had not selected him as his successor.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=277}} After Hitler's death, Speer offered his services to the so-called [[Flensburg Government]], headed by Hitler's successor, [[Karl Dönitz]]. He took a role in that short-lived regime as Minister of Industry and Production.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=273–281}} Speer provided information to the Allies, regarding the effects of the air war, and on a broad range of subjects, beginning on May 10. On May 23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=288}}

==Post-war==
===Nuremberg trial===
{{Main|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Albert-Speer-72-929.jpg|thumb|Speer at the Nuremberg trial]]
Speer was taken to several internment centres for Nazi officials and interrogated. In September 1945, he was told that he would be tried for [[war crime]]s, and several days later, he was moved to Nuremberg and incarcerated there.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=561}} Speer was indicted on four counts: participating in a common plan or [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of [[crime against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[war of aggression|wars of aggression]] and other crimes against peace; war crimes; and [[crimes against humanity]].{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=285}}

The chief United States prosecutor, [[Robert H. Jackson]], of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] said, "Speer joined in planning and executing the program to dragoon prisoners of war and foreign workers into German war industries, which waxed in output while the workers waned in starvation."{{sfn|Conot|1983|p=471}} Speer's attorney, Hans Flächsner, presented Speer as an artist thrust into political life who had always remained a non-ideologue.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=287–288}}

Speer was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, principally for the use of slave labor and forced labor. He was acquitted on the other two counts. He had claimed that he was unaware of Nazi extermination plans, and the Allies had no proof that he was aware, and this probably saved him from hanging. His claim was revealed to be false in a private correspondence written in 1971 and publicly disclosed in 2007.{{sfn|Connolly|2007}} On October 1, 1946, he was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=281–282}} While three of the eight judges (two Soviet and American [[Francis Biddle]]) advocated the death penalty for Speer, the other judges did not, and a compromise sentence was reached after two days of discussions.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=29}}

===Imprisonment===
On July 18, 1947, Speer was transferred to [[Spandau Prison]] in Berlin to serve his prison term.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=288}} There he was known as Prisoner Number Five.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=314–315}} Speer's parents died while he was incarcerated. His father, who died in 1947, despised the Nazis and was silent upon meeting Hitler. His mother died in 1952. As a Nazi member, she had greatly enjoyed dining with Hitler.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}} Wolters and longtime Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau did what they could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication he was officially allowed. Beginning in 1948, Speer had the services of Toni Proost, a sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail and his writings.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=292–297}}
[[File:6th Inf Regt Spandau Prison 1951.jpg|thumb|left|Speer spent most of his sentence at [[Spandau Prison]].]]

In 1949, Wolters opened a bank account for Speer and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. Initially, the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but increasingly the money was used for other purposes. They paid for Toni Proost to go on holiday, and for bribes to those who might be able to secure Speer's release. Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he sent detailed instructions about what to do with the money.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=292–297}} Wolters raised a total of [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=298}}

The prisoners were forbidden to write memoirs. Speer was able to have his writings sent to Wolters, however, and they eventually amounted to 20,000 pages.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=316}} He had completed his memoirs by November 1953, which became the basis of ''Inside the Third Reich''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=325}} In ''Spandau Diaries'', Speer aimed to present himself as a tragic hero who had made a [[Faustian bargain]] for which he endured a harsh prison sentence.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=321–322}}

Much of Speer's energy was dedicated to keeping fit, both physically and mentally, during his long confinement.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=323}} Spandau had a large enclosed yard where inmates were allocated plots of land for gardening. Speer created an elaborate garden complete with lawns, flower beds, shrubbery, and fruit trees.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=316}} To make his daily walks around the garden more engaging Speer embarked on an imaginary trip around the globe. Carefully measuring distance travelled each day, he mapped distances to the real-world geography. He had walked more than {{convert|30,000|km}}, ending his sentence near [[Guadalajara]], Mexico.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=316, 325}} Speer also read, studied architectural journals, and brushed up on English and French. In his writings, Speer claimed to have finished five thousand books while in prison, a gross exaggeration. His sentence amounted to 7,300 days, which only allotted one and a half days per book.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=316–317}}

Speer's supporters maintained calls for his release. Among those who pledged support for his sentence to be commuted were [[Charles de Gaulle]] and US diplomat [[George Wildman Ball]].{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=319}} [[Willy Brandt]] was an advocate of his release,{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=319}} putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against him,{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=324}} which could have caused his property to be confiscated.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=299–300}} Speer's efforts for an early release came to naught. The Soviet Union, having demanded a death sentence at trial, was unwilling to entertain a reduced sentence.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=320–321}} Speer served a full term and was released at midnight on October 1, 1966.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=324–325}}

===Release and later life===
Speer's release from prison was a worldwide media event. Reporters and photographers crowded both the street outside Spandau and the lobby of the Berlin hotel where Speer spent the night.{{sfn|Fest|1999|pp=320–321}} He said little, reserving most comments for a major interview published in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in November 1966.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=333–334}} Although he stated he hoped to resume an architectural career, his sole project, a collaboration for a brewery, was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–328}} Instead, he revised his Spandau writings into two autobiographical books, and later published a work about Himmler and the SS. His books included ''[[Inside the Third Reich]]'' (in German, ''Erinnerungen'', or ''Reminiscences''{{sfn|Sereny|1995|p=5}}) and ''[[Spandau: The Secret Diaries]]''. Speer was aided in shaping the works by [[Joachim Fest]] and [[Wolf Jobst Siedler]] from the publishing house [[Ullstein Verlag|Ullstein]].{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=329–330}} He found himself unable to re-establish a relationship with his children, even with his son [[Albert Speer (born 1934)|Albert]] who had also become an architect. According to Speer's daughter [[Hilde Schramm]], "One by one my sister and brothers gave up. There was no communication."{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=664–665}} He supported Hermann, his brother, financially after the war. However, his other brother Ernst had died in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], despite repeated requests from his parents for Speer to repatriate him.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|p=124}}

Following his release from Spandau, Speer donated the ''Chronicle'', his personal diary, to the [[German Federal Archives]]. It had been edited by Wolters and made no mention of the Jews.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=339–343}} [[David Irving]] discovered discrepancies between the deceptively edited ''Chronicle'' and independent documents. Speer asked Wolters to destroy the material he had omitted from his donation but Wolters refused and retained an original copy.{{sfn|Sereny|1995|pp=226–227}} Wolters' friendship with Speer deteriorated and one year before Speer's death Wolters gave Matthias Schmidt access to the unedited ''Chronicle''. Schmidt authored the first book that was highly critical of Speer.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=359–361}}

Speer's memoirs were a phenomenal success. The public was fascinated by an inside view of the Third Reich and a major war criminal became a popular figure almost overnight. Importantly, he provided an alibi to older Germans who had been Nazis. If Speer, who had been so close to Hitler, had not known the full extent of the crimes of the Nazi regime and had just been "following orders", then they could tell themselves and others they too had done the same.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=335}} Speer provided a whitewash for an entire generation of older Germans. So great was the need to believe this "Speer Myth" that Fest and Siedler were able to strengthen it—even in the face of mounting historical evidence to the contrary.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=366}}

===Death===
[[File:A speer grab-1.jpg|thumb|Speer's grave in [[Heidelberg]]]]
Speer made himself widely available to historians and other enquirers.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=354}} In October 1973, he made his first trip to Britain, flying to London to be interviewed on the [[BBC]] ''Midweek'' programme.{{sfn|Asher|2003}} In the same year, he appeared on the television programme ''[[The World at War]]''. Speer returned to London in 1981 to participate in the BBC ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme. He suffered a stroke and died in London on September 1.{{sfn|Fest|1999|p=337}}

He had remained married to his wife, but he had formed a relationship with a German woman living in London and was with her at the time of his death.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=362–363}} His daughter, [[Margret Nissen]], wrote in her 2005 memoirs that after his release from Spandau he spent all of his time constructing the "Speer Myth".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=343}}

==The Speer myth==
===The Good Nazi===
After his release from Spandau, Speer portrayed himself as the "good Nazi".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=327–360}} He was well-educated, middle class, [[bourgeois]] and could contrast himself with the [[psychopaths]] and murderers who, in the popular mind, typified "bad Nazis".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=362}} In his memoirs and interviews, he had distorted the truth and made so many major omissions that his lies became known as "myths".{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Speer took his myth-making to a mass media level and his "cunning apologies" were reproduced countless times in post-war Germany.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} [[Isabell Trommer]] writes in her biography of Speer that Fest and Siedler were co-authors of Speer's memoirs and co-creators of his myths.{{sfn|Trommer|2016|p=80}} In return they were paid handsomely in royalties and other financial inducements.{{sfn|Schwendemann|2016}} Speer, Siedler and Fest had constructed a masterpiece; the image of the "good Nazi" remained in place for decades, despite historical evidence indicating that it was false.{{sfn|Trommer|2016|p=330}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-052-06A, Albert Speer spricht in Munitionsfabrik.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white photograph of a group of men wearing business suits raising their right arms in a Nazi salute|Speer during a visit to a munitions factory in May 1944]]

Speer had carefully constructed an image of himself as an [[Apoliticism|apolitical]] technocrat who deeply regretted having failed to discover the monstrous crimes of the Third Reich.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=345–346}} After Speer's death, Matthias Schmidt published a book that demonstrated that Speer had ordered the eviction of Jews from their Berlin homes.{{sfn|Schmidt|1984|p=186}} By 1999, historians had amply demonstrated that he had lied extensively.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=360–362}} Even so, public perceptions of Speer did not change substantially until [[Heinrich Breloer]] aired a biographical film on TV in 2004. The film began a process of demystification and critical reappraisal.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=335}} [[Adam Tooze]] in his book ''[[The Wages of Destruction]]'' said Speer had manoeuvred himself through the ranks of the regime skillfully and ruthlessly and that the idea he was a technocrat blindly carrying out orders was "absurd".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=553}} Trommer said he was not an apolitical technocrat; instead, he was one of the most powerful and unscrupulous leaders in the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Schwendemann|2016}} Kitchen said he had deceived the Nuremberg Tribunal and post-war Germany.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=360–362}} Brechtken said that if his extensive involvement in the Holocaust had been known at the time of his trial he would have been sentenced to death.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}}

The image of the good Nazi was supported by numerous Speer myths.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} In addition to the myth that he was an apolitical technocrat, he claimed he did not have full knowledge of [[the Holocaust]] or the persecution of the Jews. Another myth posits that Speer revolutionized the German war machine after his appointment as Minister of Armaments. He was credited with a dramatic increase in the shipment of arms that was widely reported as keeping Germany in the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=552}} Another myth centered around a faked plan to assassinate Hitler with poisonous gas. The idea for this myth came to him after he recalled the panic when car fumes came through an air ventilation system. He fabricated the additional details.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=296–297}} Brechtken wrote that his most brazen lie was fabricated during an interview with a French journalist in 1952. The journalist described an invented scenario in which Speer had refused Hitler's orders and Hitler had left with tears in his eyes. Speer liked the scenario so much that he wrote it into his memoirs. The journalist had unwittingly collaborated in one of his myths.{{sfn|Reinecke|2017}}

Speer also sought to portray himself as an opponent of Hitler's leadership. Despite his opposition to the [[20 July plot]], he falsely claimed in his memoirs to have been sympathetic to the plotters. He maintained Hitler was cool towards him for the remainder of his life after learning they had included him on a list of potential ministers. This formed a key element of the myths Speer encouraged.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=205}} Speer also falsely claimed that he had realised the war was lost at an early stage, and thereafter worked to preserve the resources needed for the civilian population's survival.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}} In reality, he had sought to prolong the war until further resistance was impossible, thus contributing to the large number of deaths and the extensive destruction Germany suffered in the conflict's final months.{{sfn|Kershaw|2012|p=289}}{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=653}}

===Denial of responsibility===
{{external media|align=left||image1=[https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2018/12/18/albert-speer-chief-architect-of-the-third-reich/ Photograph of Speer at Mauthausen]}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-207, KZ Mauthausen, Häftlinge bei der Desinfektion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A group several hundred naked men is crowded in an enclosed courtyard, with garage doors visible on three sides.|New prisoners awaiting disinfection in the garage yard of [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex|Mauthausen concentration camp]]]]
Speer maintained at the Nuremberg trials and in his memoirs that he had no direct knowledge of the Holocaust. He admitted only to being uncomfortable around Jews in the published version of the ''Spandau Diaries''.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=322}} More broadly, Speer accepted responsibility for the Nazi regime's actions. Historian Martin Kitchen states that Speer was actually "fully aware of what had happened to the Jews" and was "intimately involved in the '[[Final Solution]]'".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|pp=100, 322}} Brechtken said Speer only admitted to a generalized responsibility for the Holocaust to hide his direct and actual responsibility.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Speer was photographed with slave laborers at [[Mauthausen concentration camp]] during a visit on 31 March 1943; he also visited [[Gusen concentration camp]]. Although survivor [[Francisco Boix]] testified at the Nuremberg trials about Speer's visit,{{sfn|Pike|2003|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W_6CAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 340, fn 40]}} Taylor writes that, had the photo been available, he would have been hanged.{{sfn|Taylor|2010|pp=204–205}} In 2005, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that documents had surfaced indicating that Speer had approved the allocation of materials for the expansion of [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] after two of his assistants inspected the facility on a day when almost a thousand Jews were massacred.{{sfn|Connolly|2005}} Heinrich Breloer, discussing the construction of Auschwitz, said Speer was not just a cog in the work—he was the "terror itself".{{sfn|Connolly|2005}}

Speer denied being present at the [[Posen speeches]] to Nazi leaders at a conference in Posen ([[Poznań]]) on October 6, 1943. Himmler said during his speech, "The grave decision had to be taken to cause this people to vanish from the earth",{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|pp=167–168}} and later, "The Jews must be exterminated".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} Speer is mentioned several times in the speech, and Himmler addresses him directly.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=345}} In 2007, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that a letter from Speer dated December 23, 1971, had been found in a collection of his correspondence with Hélène Jeanty, the widow of a Belgian resistance fighter. In the letter, Speer says, "There is no doubt—I was present as Himmler announced on October 6, 1943, that all Jews would be killed."{{sfn|Connolly|2007}}

===Armaments "miracle"===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|right|The German city of Cologne in ruins at the end of the war]]
Speer was credited with an "armaments miracle". During the winter of 1941–42, in the light of Germany's disastrous defeat in the [[Battle of Moscow]], the German leadership including Fromm, Thomas and Todt had come to the conclusion that the war could not be won.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} The rational position to adopt was to seek a political solution that would end the war without defeat. Speer in response used his propaganda expertise to display a new dynamism of the war economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}} He produced spectacular statistics, claiming a sixfold increase in munitions production, a fourfold increase in artillery production, and he sent further propaganda to the newsreels of the country. He was able to curtail the discussion that the war should be ended.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=554}}

The armaments "miracle" was a myth; Speer had used statistical manipulation to support his claims.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=555}} The production of armaments did go up; however, this was due to the normal causes of reorganization before Speer came to office, the relentless mobilization of slave labor and a deliberate reduction in the quality of output to favor quantity. By July 1943 Speer's armaments propaganda became irrelevant because a catalogue of dramatic defeats on the battlefield meant the prospect of losing the war could no longer be hidden from the German public.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=552–557}} Brechtken writes that Speer knew Germany was going to lose the war and deliberately extended its length, thus causing the deaths of millions of people in the death camps and on the battlefield who would have otherwise lived.{{sfn|Seelow|2018}} Kitchen said "There can be no doubt that Speer did indeed help to prolong the war longer than many thought possible, as a result of which millions were killed and Germany reduced to a pile of rubble".{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=364}}

==Architectural legacy==
[[File:09055087 Berlin Tempelhof, General-Pape-Straße 002.JPG|thumb|alt=Colour photograph of a cylindrical structure|''Schwerbelastungskörper'' in 2011]]

Little remains of Speer's personal architectural works, other than the plans and photographs. No buildings designed by Speer during the Nazi era are extant in Berlin, other than the ''[[Schwerbelastungskörper]]'', a heavy load-bearing body built around 1941. The concrete cylinder, {{convert|46|ft|m|adj=off|order=flip|abbr=}} high, was used to measure ground [[subsidence]] as part of feasibility studies for a massive [[triumphal arch]] and other large structures proposed as part of ''[[Germania (city)|Welthauptstadt Germania]]'', Hitler's planned post-war renewal project for the city. The cylinder is now a protected landmark and is open to the public.{{sfn|van der Vat|1997|p=75}} The [[Tribune (architecture)|tribune]] of the ''Zeppelinfeld'' stadium in Nuremberg, though partly demolished, can also be seen.{{sfn|Museen der Stadt Nürnberg}}

During the war, the Speer-designed [[Reich Chancellery#New Reich Chancellery|Reich Chancellery]] was largely destroyed by air raids and in the [[Battle of Berlin]]. The exterior walls survived, but they were eventually dismantled by the Soviets. Unsubstantiated rumors have claimed that the remains were used for other building projects such as the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]], [[Mohrenstraße (Berlin U-Bahn)|Mohrenstraße metro station]] and Soviet war memorials in Berlin.{{sfn|Kitchen|2015|p=56}}

Aachen developed from a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] settlement and spa, subsequently becoming the preferred medieval Imperial residence of Emperor [[Charlemagne]] of the [[Frankish Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.historicgermany.travel/historic-cities/aachen |title=Aachen {{!}} Historic Highlights of Germany |last=Mueller |first=Joerg |date=26 July 2017 |website=www.historicgermany.travel |access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, from 936 to 1531, the place where 31 [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] were crowned [[List of German monarchs|Kings of the Germans]].&lt;ref name="munro" /&gt;

Aachen is the westernmost city in Germany, located near the borders with [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], {{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Cologne]]&lt;ref name="CVDE"&gt;{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{harvnb|Bayer|2000|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in a former coal-mining area.&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; One of Germany's leading institutes of higher education in technology, the [[RWTH Aachen University]], is located in the city.&lt;ref name="rwth-aachen.de"&gt;{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology. In 2009, Aachen was ranked eighth among cities in Germany for innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The name ''Aachen'' is a modern descendant, like southern German {{lang|de|Ach(e)}}, {{lang-de|Aach}}, meaning "river" or "stream", from [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|ahha}}, meaning "water" or "stream", which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds) to [[Latin]] {{lang|la|Aquae}}, referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the [[Neolithic]] era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm [[mineral spring]]s. Latin {{lang|la|Aquae}} figures in Aachen's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name {{lang|la|Aquae granni}}, which meant "waters of [[Grannus]]", referring to the [[Celts|Celtic]] god of healing who was worshipped at the springs.&lt;ref name="munro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tourism"&gt;{{harvnb|Mielke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This word became {{lang|wa|Åxhe}} in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and {{lang|fr|Aix}} in French, and subsequently {{lang|fr|Aix-la-Chapelle}} after [[Charlemagne]] had his [[palatine Chapel, Aachen|palatine chapel]] built there in the late 8th century and then made the city his empire's capital.

As a spa city, Aachen has the right to name itself ''Bad Aachen'', but chooses not to, so it remains on the top of alphabetical lists.

Aachen's name in French and German evolved in parallel. The city is known by a variety of different names in other languages:

=== Aachen dialect ===
Aachen is at the western end of the [[Benrath line]] that divides [[High German languages|High German]] to the south from the rest of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] speech area to the north.&lt;ref name="Anon 2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen's local dialect is called {{lang|de|[[Aachen dialect|Öcher Platt]]}} and belongs to the [[Ripuarian language]].

== History ==
{{see also|Free Imperial City of Aachen|Timeline of Aachen}}

=== Early history ===
Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3000–2500 BC), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (around 1600 BC) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshipped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of Aquae Granni was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], around 124 AD. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century AD that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel,&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;{{efn|This audio file is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Archäologie am Hof''.}} adding at the end of the same century the ''Münstertherme'' spa,&lt;ref name="Anon 2013"/&gt; two water pipelines, and a probable{{clarify|date=December 2016}} sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Freimann|1906|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelimünster/Walheim]]. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses,&lt;ref name="DofA"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse.

Roman civil administration in Aachen broke down between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries&lt;!--{{Fix|text=This seems rather precise}} What is that supposed to imply?--&gt;. Rome withdrew its troops from the area, but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]&lt;ref name="Coll"&gt;{{harvnb|Held|1997|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
[[File:Aachener Heiligtumszeigung Oelgemaelde 17Jh.jpg|thumb|Presentation of the four "Great Relics" during the Aachen [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]], after a 17th-century painting]]

After Roman times, [[Pepin the Short]] had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the [[Rhineland]] and northern France.&lt;ref name="DofA2"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' (''{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eginhard|2012|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ("and [he] celebrated Christmas in the town Aquis, and similarly Easter") which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as king of the [[Francia|Franks]], 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time.{{efn|This is in dispute, as some history books state that Charlemagne was in fact born in Aachen in 742.&lt;ref name="WB" /&gt;}} He remained there in a mansion which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] (since 1930, cathedral) and the [[Palace of Aachen|Palace]]. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built;&lt;ref name="DofA5"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the ''[[Karlsschrein]]'', the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never officially acknowledged by the Roman Curia as such.

In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of [[East Francia]] in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. During the reign of [[Otto II]], the nobles revolted and the [[West Francia|West Frank]]s, under [[Lothair of France|Lothair]],&lt;ref name="dupuy"&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This was between 970 and 980.&lt;ref name="dupuy" /&gt;}} Aachen was attacked again by [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Odo of Champagne]], who attacked the imperial palace while [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was absent. Odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The palace and town of Aachen had fortifying walls built by order of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] between 1172 and 1176.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; Over the next 500 years, most kings of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned in Aachen. The original audience hall built by Charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]] in 1330.{{efn|Sources differ on the age of the [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], as the dates used for the construction were 1334–1349.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]]; it achieved a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the "Aachener Reich". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political privileges that allowed it to remain independent{{clarify|date=December 2016}} of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It was also the site of many important church councils, including the [[Council of 837]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Jong|1996|p=279}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt;

[[File:The Siege of Aachen.png|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Siege of Aachen (1614)|siege of Aachen]] by the Spanish Army of Flanders under Ambrogio Spinola in 1614]]
Aachen has proved an important site for the production of historical manuscripts. Under Charlemagne's purview, both the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Ada Gospels]] and the [[Coronation Gospel]]s may have been produced in Aachen.&lt;ref name="DofA1"&gt;{{harvnb|McKitterick|1996|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally. During the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814–840), substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at Aachen, including legal manuscripts such as the leges scriptorium group, [[patristic]] texts including the five manuscripts of the [[Bamberg Pliny Group]].&lt;ref name="DofA1" /&gt; Finally, under [[Lothair I]] (840–855), texts of outstanding quality were still being produced. This however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at Aachen.&lt;ref name="DofA1" /&gt;

=== 16th–18th centuries ===
[[File:Rhein-Strom 0184a Achen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|View of Aachen in 1690]]

In 1598, following the invasion of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] troops from the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf]] deposed all [[Protestantism|Protestant]] office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the early 16th century, Aachen started to lose its power and influence. First the [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|coronations of emperors]] were moved from Aachen to [[Frankfurt]]. This was followed by the [[European wars of religion|religious wars]], and the great fire of 1656.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;{{harvnb|''Encyclopædia Britannica''|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the destruction of most of the city in 1656, the rebuilding was mostly in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style.&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt; The decline of Aachen culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General [[Charles Dumouriez]],&lt;ref name="Coll" /&gt; occupied Aachen.&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt;

In 1542, the Dutch [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] and physician [[Francis Fabricius]] published his study of the health benefits of the hot springs in Aachen,&lt;ref&gt;"Fabricius, François", in ''Dictionnaire des sciences médicales: biographie médicale'', vol. 4 (Paris, C. L. F. Panckoucke, 1821), p. 92. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4OI-AAAAcAAJ On Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; and by the middle of the 17th century the city had developed a considerable reputation as a spa, although this was in part because Aachen was then – and remained well into the 19th century – a place of high-level prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=July 2020}} Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history are found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas.

The main [[Indication (medicine)|indication]] for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had [[rheumatism]] become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid.

Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in English) on 2 May 1668,&lt;ref name="dupuy1"&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=563}}.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=70}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, ending the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis in the Aachen government,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2004|p=301}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1794 Aachen lost its status as a [[free imperial city]].&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;

=== 19th century ===
[[File:KleineSchwimmhalle.JPG|thumb|The modern Elisabethhalle pool]]
On 9 February 1801, the [[Peace of Lunéville]] removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire "left bank" of the Rhine from Germany (the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) and granted it to France.&lt;ref name="Coll" /&gt; In 1815, control of the town was passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] through an act passed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].&lt;ref name="DofA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818, to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation had swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt{{clarify|date=December 2016}} remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the "[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]" in Napoleon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over within the new [[German Confederation]]. The city was one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt; Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions until 1875, when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building and new, better housing was built in the east of the city, where sanitary drainage was easiest. In December 1880, the [[Trams in Aachen|Aachen tramway network]] was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Gragt|1968|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important in the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, pins, [[sewing needle|needles]], buttons, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.

=== 20th century ===
====World War II====
{{further|Battle of Aachen}}

[[File:111-adc-2447.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|thumbtime=06:42|start=00:08|Films shot on 13, 14 and 15 October 1944 in Aachen by US forces.]]
After [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930, along with the rest of German territory west of the Rhine.&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]]. On 21 October 1923, an armed mob took over the city hall. Similar actions took place in [[Mönchengladbach|Mönchen-Gladbach]], [[Duisburg]], and [[Krefeld]]. This republic lasted only about a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=614}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. According to [[Jörg Friedrich (author)|Jörg Friedrich]] in ''The Fire'' (2008), two Allied air raids on 11 April and 24 May 1944 "radically destroyed" the city. The first killed 1,525, including 212 children, and bombed six hospitals. During the second, 442 aircraft hit two railway stations, killed 207, and left 15,000 homeless. The raids also destroyed [[Eilendorf (Aachen)|Aachen-Eilendorf]] and [[Burtscheid|Aachen-Burtscheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Friedrich|2008|p=[https://archive.org/details/firebombingofger00frie/page/117 117]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from 12 September to 21 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division&lt;ref name="1d"&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with the 3rd Armored Division assisting from the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 13 October the US 2nd Armored Division played their part, coming from the north and getting as close as [[Würselen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while the 30th Infantry Division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of Aachen on 16 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=109}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With reinforcements from the US 28th Infantry Division&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=105}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of Aachen]] then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city, which finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.&lt;ref name="1d" /&gt;

Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.&lt;ref name="baker2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|2004|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; What remained of the city was destroyed—in some areas completely—during the fighting,&lt;ref name="CVDE" /&gt; mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Aachen Rathaus|Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit.

==== History of Aachen Jews ====
[[File:View of the old synagogue in Aachen after its destruction during Kristallnacht 02.jpg|thumb|View of the {{ill|Old Synagogue in Aachen|de|Alte Synagoge (Aachen)}} after its destruction during [[Kristallnacht]], November 1938]]
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community lived near the royal palace.&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com" /&gt; In 797, Isaac, a Jewish merchant, accompanied two ambassadors of [[Charlemagne]] to the court of [[Harun al-Rashid]]. He returned to Aachen in July 802, bearing an elephant called ''[[Abul-Abbas]]'' as a gift for the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 July 2003 |title=Baghdad, Jerusalem, Aachen -- On the Trail of the White Elephant |url=https://www.dw.com/en/baghdad-jerusalem-aachen-on-the-trail-of-the-white-elephant/a-923561 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=18 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the [[Aachen Cathedral|Aachen Minster]] (today's Cathedral). In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called ''Aish'' or ''Ash'' (אש).

=== 21st century ===
The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.

== Geography ==
[[File:2017-05 Vaalserberg 13.jpg|thumb|The tripoint, where the borders of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands meet at the [[Vaalserberg]]]]

Aachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion]], close to [[Vaalserberg#Three-Country Point|the border tripoint of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium]]. The town of [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands lies nearby at about {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen's city centre, while the Dutch city of [[Heerlen]] and [[Eupen]], the capital of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], are both located about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from Aachen city centre. Aachen lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} from east to west. The city limits are {{convert|87.7|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, of which {{convert|23.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|frac=8|abbr=on}} the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of {{convert|410|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at {{convert|125|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

=== Climate ===
As the westernmost city in Germany&lt;ref name="munro"&gt;{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate climate zone]], with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&amp;nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, in [[Bonn]] (with 669&amp;nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography and from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environment|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The January average is
{{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

== Geology ==
[[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|Layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]]

The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[greywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first= David |year=2012 |title=Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust |issue=367 |volume=367 |publisher=Geological Society of London |isbn=978-1-86239-347-9 |issn=0305-8719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.

Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous [[active fault]]s that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has been responsible for numerous earthquakes in the past, including the 1756 [[Düren]] earthquake&lt;ref name="duerenEQ"&gt;{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],&lt;ref name="Roermond"&gt;{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].

== Demographics ==
[[File:Age structure aachen vs germany.svg|thumb|Age distribution of Aachen's population next to Germany's (2014)]]

Aachen has 245,885 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2015), of whom 118,272 are female, and 127,613 are male.&lt;ref name="Zensus 2011"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |last=Information und Technik Nordrhein-Westfalen |title=Bevölkerung im Regierungsbezirk Köln |access-date=16 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408003047/https://www.it.nrw.de/statistik/a/daten/bevoelkerungszahlen_zensus/zensus_rp3_dez15.html |archive-date=8 April 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate in the city is, as of April 2012, 9.7 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aktualisierung|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2009, the foreign-born residents of Aachen made up 13.6 percent of the total population.&lt;ref name="StatJahrbuch2009"&gt;{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A significant portion of foreign residents are students at the [[RWTH Aachen University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main sights ==

=== Aachen Cathedral ===
{{Main|Aachen Cathedral}}
[[File:Aachen Germany Imperial-Cathedral-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Aachen Cathedral]]

Aachen Cathedral was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]]. Construction began ''c.'' AD 796&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; and it was, on completion ''c.'' 798,&lt;ref name="DofA3"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], Italy,&lt;ref name="AAE" /&gt; and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].&lt;ref name="EA" /&gt; Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the [[Lateran Palace]], both in quality and authority.&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; It was originally built in the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome.&lt;ref name="DofA4"&gt;{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.&lt;ref name="DofA4" /&gt; The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was added around the start of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="DofA5" /&gt;

After [[Frederick Barbarossa]] [[Canonisation|canonised]] Charlemagne in 1165 the chapel became a [[Pilgrimage|destination for pilgrims]].&lt;ref name="DofA5" /&gt; For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. In the upper chamber of the gallery, Charlemagne's marble throne is housed.&lt;ref name="young2"&gt;{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=273}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Aachen |title=Aachen {{!}} Germany |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from Rome and [[Ravenna]], including the [[sarcophagus]] in which Charlemagne was eventually laid to rest.&lt;ref name="DofA6"&gt;{{harvnb|Gaehde|1996|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A bronze bear from [[Gaul]] was placed inside, along with an equestrian statue from Ravenna, believed to be [[Theodric]], in contrast to a wolf and a statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Capitoline]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Bronze pieces such as the doors and railings, some of which have survived to present day, were cast in a local foundry. Finally, there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel, and where it was created. Wherever it was made, it was also a parallel to a piece in Rome, this in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt;

=== Cathedral Treasury ===
{{Main|Aachen Cathedral Treasury}}[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cross of Lothair]], Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]

Aachen Cathedral Treasury has housed, throughout its history, a collection of liturgical objects. The origin of this [[church treasure]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; The location of this treasury has moved over time and was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in the Matthiaskapelle (St. Matthew's Chapel) until 1873, when it was moved to the Karlskapelle (Charles' Chapel). From there it was moved to the Hungarian Chapel in 1881 and in 1931 to its present location next to the Allerseelenkapelle (Poor Souls' Chapel).&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Only six of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects have remained, and of those only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of Christ, and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]] in 1798 and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Rheims Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. Part of the [[Aachen Cathedral#Pala d'Oro|Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] were made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and also once "crowned" the [[Karlsschrein|Shrine of Charlemagne]], which was placed underneath in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt; Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Mataré]].&lt;ref name="DofA6" /&gt;

=== Aachen Rathaus ===
{{Main|Aachen Rathaus}}[[File:AachenCityHallFromSouthHDR.jpg|thumb|Aachen Rathaus seen from the south]]
The Aachen Rathaus, (English: Aachen City Hall or Aachen Town Hall) dated from 1330,&lt;ref name="WB"&gt;{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; lies between two central squares, the ''Markt'' (marketplace) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside one can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist [[Alfred Rethel]] which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. Also, precious replicas of the [[Imperial Regalia]] are kept here.&lt;ref name="young2" /&gt;

Since 2009, the city hall has been a station on the ''Route Charlemagne'', a tour programme by which historical sights of Aachen are presented to visitors. At the city hall, a museum exhibition explains the history and art of the building and gives a sense of the historical coronation banquets that took place there. A portrait of [[Napoleon]] from 1807 by [[Louis-André-Gabriel Bouchet]] and one of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]] from 1805 by [[Robert Lefèvre]] are viewable as part of the tour.

As before, the city hall is the seat of the mayor of Aachen and of the city council, and annually the [[Charlemagne Prize]] is awarded there.

=== Other sights ===
The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the ''Fischmarkt'', is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in central Aachen. It hosted the city archive, and before that, the Grashaus was the city hall until the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in a south-easterly direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), {{convert|1/2|mi|m|order=flip|abbr=off}} northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine [[mannerism]], and a sample of a local [[Renaissance architecture]]. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891, when the architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The synagogue in Aachen, which was destroyed on the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]), 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the contributors to the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[Jürgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.

There are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the [[Suermondt-Ludwig Museum]], which has a fine sculpture collection and the [[Aachen Museum of the International Press]], which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

=== Electric vehicle manufacturing ===
[[File:2016-12-10-Post Streetscooter-9409.jpg|thumb|StreetScooter ''Work'' as DHL delivery van (2016)]]

In June 2010, Achim Kampker, together with Günther Schuh, founded a small company to develop Street Scooter GmbH; in August 2014, it was renamed StreetScooter GmbH. This was a privately organised research initiative at the [[RWTH Aachen University]] which later became an independent company in Aachen. Kampker was also the founder and chairman of the European Network for Affordable and Sustainable Electromobility. In May 2014, the company announced that the city of Aachen, the city council Aachen and the savings bank Aachen had ordered electric vehicles from the company. In late 2014, approximately 70 employees were manufacturing 200 vehicles annually in the premises of the [[Waggonfabrik Talbot]], the former Talbot/Bombardier plant in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhl.com/en/press/releases/releases_2014/group/dpdhl_acquires_streetscooter_gmbh.html |title=Deutsche Post DHL acquires StreetScooter GmbH |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=9 December 2014 |website=DHL |publisher=DHL |access-date=26 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014 [[Deutsche Post|Deutsche Post DHL Group]] purchased the StreetScooter company, which became its wholly owned subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpdhl.com/de/presse/pressemitteilungen/2014/deutsche_post_dhl_uebernimmt_streetscooter_gmbh.html Deutsche Post DHL übernimmt StreetScooter GmbH] 9.&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2016, the company announced that it would produce 2000 of its electric vans branded ''Work'' in Aachen by the end of the year.

In 2015, the electric vehicle start-up [[e.GO Mobile]] was founded by Günther Schuh, which started producing the e.GO Life electric passenger car and other vehicles in April 2019.

In April 2016, [[StreetScooter]] GmbH announced that it would be scaling up to manufacture approximately 10,000 of the ''Work'' vehicles annually, starting in 2017, also in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/unternehmen/der-tausendste-elektro-streetscooter-der-deutschen-post-14401894.html |title=Streetscooter – Der tausendste Elektro-Transporter der Post |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=23 August 2016 |website=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung |publisher=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH |access-date=26 March 2017 |quote=Die Post will ihren gesamten Fuhrpark auf Elektro-Autos umstellen.

* In 1372, Aachen became the first coin-minting city in the world to regularly place an [[anno Domini]] date on a general circulation [[coin]], a [[groschen]].
* The [[Scotch Club]] in Aachen was the first [[discothèque]] in Germany, opened from 19 October 1959 until 1992. Klaus Quirini as DJ Heinrich was the first DJ ever.
* The thriving Aachen [[black metal]] scene is among the most notable in Germany, with such bands as [[Nagelfar]], [[The Ruins of Beverast]], Graupel and Verdunkeln.
* The local speciality of Aachen is an originally hard type of sweet bread, baked in large flat loaves, called ''[[Aachener Printen]]''. Unlike ''[[Lebkuchen]]'', a German form of [[gingerbread]] sweetened with honey, ''Printen'' use a syrup made from sugar. Today, a soft version is sold under the same name which follows an entirely different recipe.

[[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]], established as Polytechnicum in 1870, is one of [[German Universities Excellence Initiative|Germany's Universities of Excellence]] with strong emphasis on technological research, especially for electrical and mechanical engineering, computer sciences, physics, and chemistry. The university clinic attached to the RWTH, the [[Klinikum Aachen]], is the biggest single-building hospital in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aachen Institute for Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, a host of software and computer industries have developed around the university. It also maintains a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Aachen]]).

[[FH Aachen]], Aachen University of Applied Sciences (AcUAS) was founded in 1971. The AcUAS offers a classic engineering education in professions such as [[mechatronics]], construction engineering, mechanical engineering or electrical engineering. German and international students are educated in more than 20 international or foreign-oriented programmes and can acquire German as well as international degrees (Bachelor/Master) or ''Doppelabschlüsse'' (double degrees). Foreign students account for more than 21% of the student body.

The Katholische Hochschule Nordrhein-Westfalen – Abteilung Aachen (Catholic University of Applied Sciences Northrhine-Westphalia – Aachen department)&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; offers its some 750 students a variety of degree programmes: social work, childhood education, nursing, and co-operative management. It also has the only programme of study in Germany especially designed for mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Catholic University of Applied Sciences|2014a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hochschule für Musik und Tanz Köln]] ([[Cologne University of Music]]) is one of the world's foremost performing arts schools and one of the largest music institutions for higher education in Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with one of its three campuses in Aachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Academy of Music and Dance Cologne|2014a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aachen campus substantially contributes to the Opera/Musical Theatre master's programme by collaborating with the [[Theater Aachen]] and the recently established musical theatre chair through the Rheinische Opernakademie.

The [[German army]]'s Technical School (''Ausbildungszentrum Technik Landsysteme'') is in Aachen.&lt;ref name="MeerOpitz1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Van der Meer|Richter|Opitz|1998|p=718}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports ==
[[File:Tivoli-Ost-Tribüne.JPG|thumb|left|[[New Tivoli]], home ground of [[Alemannia Aachen]]]]

The annual [[CHIO Aachen|CHIO]] (short for the French term ''Concours Hippique International Officiel'') is the biggest [[equestrianism|equestrian]] meeting of the world and among horsemen is considered to be as prestigious for equitation as the tournament of [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] for tennis. Aachen hosted the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].

The local [[Association football|football]] team [[Alemannia Aachen]] had a short run in Germany's [[Bundesliga|first division]], after its promotion in 2006. However, the team could not sustain its status and is now back in the fourth division. The stadium [[Old Tivoli|"Tivoli"]], opened in 1928, served as the venue for the team's home games and was well known for its incomparable atmosphere throughout the whole of the second division.&lt;ref name="GdawietzLeroi2007"&gt;{{harvnb|Gdawietz|Leroi|2008|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the old stadium's demolition in 2011, it was used by amateurs, whilst the Bundesliga Club held its games in the new stadium "Neuer Tivoli" – meaning [[New Tivoli]]—a couple of metres down the road. The building work for the stadium which has a capacity of 32,960, began in May 2008 and was completed by the beginning of 2009.

The Ladies in Black women's volleyball team (part of the "PTSV Aachen" sports club since 2013) has played in the first German volleyball league (DVL) since 2008.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Aachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 for the [[Cologne–Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne–Aachen railway line]]. In 1905 it was moved closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway|Mönchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''. Slower trains stop at these. Aachen West has gained in importance with the expansion of [[RWTH Aachen University]].

===Intercity bus stations===
There are two stations for [[intercity bus service]]s in Aachen: [[Aachen West station]], in the north-west of the city, and Aachen Wilmersdorfer Straße, in the north-east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/aachen|last=Travelinho|title=Aachen: Stations|access-date=10 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public transport ===
[[File:OecherLongWajong1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bi-articulated bus]] of the city's transit authority ASEAG, at the [[Klinikum Aachen|university hospital]] bus stop]]

The first horse tram line in Aachen opened in December 1880. After electrification in 1895, it attained a maximum length of {{convert|213.5|km|mi|frac=8|abbr=off}} in 1915, becoming the fourth-longest tram network in Germany. Many tram lines extended to the surrounding towns of [[Herzogenrath]], [[Stolberg (Rheinland)|Stolberg]], [[Alsdorf]] as well as the Belgian and Dutch communes of [[Vaals]], [[Kelmis]] (then ''Altenberg'') and [[Eupen]]. The Aachen tram system was linked with the [[Vicinal tramway|Belgian national interurban tram system]]. Like many tram systems in Western Europe, the Aachen tram suffered from poorly-maintained infrastructure and was so deemed unnecessary and disrupting for car drivers by local politics. On 28 September 1974 the last line 15 (Vaals–Brand) operated for one last day and was then replaced by buses. A proposal to reinstate a tram/light rail system under the name ''Campusbahn'' was dropped after a referendum.

Today, the ASEAG (''Aachener Straßenbahn und Energieversorgungs-AG'', literally "Aachen tram and power supply company") operates a {{convert|1240.8|km|mi|adj=mid|-long|frac=8}} bus network with 68 bus routes. Because of the location at the border, many bus routes extend to Belgium and the Netherlands. Lines 14 to Eupen, Belgium and 44 to Heerlen, Netherlands are jointly operated with [[Société Régionale Wallonne du Transport|Transport en Commun]] and [[Veolia Transport Nederland]], respectively. ASEAG is one of the main participants in the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (AVV), a tariff association in the region. Along with ASEAG, city bus routes of Aachen are served by private contractors such as Sadar, Taeter, Schlömer, or [[DB Regio Bus]]. Line 350, which runs from [[Maastricht]], also enters Aachen.

=== Roads ===
Aachen is connected to the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] (west-east), [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] (north-south) and A544 (a smaller motorway from the A4 to the ''Europaplatz'' near the city centre). There are plans to eliminate traffic jams at the Aachen road interchange.

=== Airport ===
[[Maastricht Aachen Airport]] {{airport codes|MST|EHBK}} is the main airport of Aachen and [[Maastricht]]. It is located around 15 nautical miles (28&amp;nbsp;km; 17&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Aachen. There is a shuttle-service between Aachen and the airport.

Recreational aviation is served by the (formerly military) [[Aachen Merzbrück Airfield]].

[[File:Angela Merkel, Karlspreisverleihung 2008 - 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]], wearing the Charlemagne Prize awarded to her in 2008]]

Since 1950, a committee of Aachen citizens annually awards the Charlemagne Prize ({{lang-de|link=no|Karlspreis}}) to personalities of outstanding service to the unification of Europe. It is traditionally awarded on [[Ascension Day]] at the [[Aachen Rathaus|City Hall]]. In 2016, the Charlemagne Award was awarded to [[Pope Francis]].

The International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen was awarded in the year 2000 to US president [[Bill Clinton]], for his special personal contribution to co-operation with the states of Europe, for the preservation of peace, freedom, democracy and [[human rights in Europe]], and for his support of the enlargement of the European Union. In 2004, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s efforts to unite Europe were honoured with an "Extraordinary Charlemagne Medal", which was awarded for the only time ever.

'''Baldassarre Cossa''' (c. 1370 – 22 December 1419) was [[Council of Pisa|Pisan]] [[antipope]] '''John XXIII''' (1410–1415) during the [[Western Schism]]. The Catholic Church regards him as an [[antipope]], as he opposed [[Pope Gregory XII]] whom the Catholic Church now recognizes as the rightful successor of Saint Peter.

Cossa was born in the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. In 1403, he served as a [[papal legate]] in Romagna. He participated in the [[Council of Pisa]] in 1408, which sought to end the Western Schism with the election of a third alternative pope. In 1410, he succeeded [[Antipope Alexander V]], taking the name John XXIII.  At the instigation of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund, King of the Romans]], Pope John called the [[Council of Constance]] of 1413, which deposed John XXIII and Benedict XIII, accepted Gregory XII's resignation, and elected [[Pope Martin V]] to replace them, thus ending the schism. John XXIII was tried for various crimes, though later accounts question the veracity of those accusations.

== Early life ==
Baldassarre Cossa was born on the island of [[Procida]] in the [[Kingdom of Naples]] to the family of Giovanni Cossa, lord of Procida. Initially he followed a military career, taking part in the [[Kingdom of Naples|Angevin-Neapolitan war]]. His two brothers were sentenced to death for [[piracy]] by [[Ladislaus of Naples]].&lt;ref name=mccabe&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph McCabe|title=Crises in the History of the Papacy|chapter=Chapter XI. John XXIII and the Great Schism|year=1916|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkX2JjO4V6sC&amp;pg=PA221|isbn=978-0-7661-7904-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied law at the [[University of Bologna]] and obtained doctorates in both civil and canon law.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2011| loc=Chapter 7}} Probably at the prompting of his family, in 1392 he entered the service of [[Pope Boniface IX]], first working in Bologna and then in Rome. (The [[Western Schism]] had begun in 1378, and there were two competing popes at the time, one in Avignon supported by France and Spain, and one in Rome, supported by most of Italy, Germany and England.) In 1386 he is listed as canon of the cathedral of Bologna. In 1396, he became archdeacon in Bologna. He became [[cardinal (Catholicism)#Cardinal deacon|Cardinal deacon]] of Saint Eustachius in 1402 and [[Papal legate]] in [[Romagna]] in 1403. [[Johann Peter Kirsch]] describes Cossa as "utterly worldly-minded, ambitious, crafty, unscrupulous, and immoral, a good soldier but no churchman".&lt;ref name=Kirsch&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08434a.htm Kirsch, Johann Peter. "John XXIII." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 2 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Cossa also had some links with local robber bands, which were often used to intimidate his rivals and attack carriages. These connections added to his influence and power in the region.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2011| p=158}}

== Role in the Western Schism ==

=== Council of Pisa ===
Cardinal Cossa was one of the seven [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] who, in May 1408, withdrew their allegiance from [[Pope Gregory XII]], stating that he had broken his solemn oath not to create new cardinals without consulting them in advance.  In company with those cardinals who had been following [[Antipope Benedict XIII]] of Avignon, they convened the [[Council of Pisa]], of which Cossa became a leading figure. The aim of the council was to end the schism; to this end they deposed both Gregory XII and Benedict XIII and elected a new pope [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] in 1409.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; Gregory and Benedict ignored this decision, however, so that there were now three simultaneous claimants to the [[papacy]].

=== Election to the papacy ===
Alexander V died soon after, and on 25 May 1410 Cossa was consecrated a bishop, taking the name John XXIII. He had become an [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|ordained priest]] only one day earlier. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia]]; however, the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Sicily (Medieval and Early Modern)|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Elector Palatine]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, R.W. (1980) ''Donatello &amp; Michelozzo''. London: Harvey Miller. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; John XXIII made the [[Medici Bank]] the bank of the papacy, contributing considerably to the family's wealth and prestige.&lt;ref name=mediateca&gt;[http://www.palazzo-medici.it/mediateca/en/Scheda_Baldassarre_Cossa "Popes and Prelates", Mediateca di Palazzo Medici]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main enemy of John was [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who protected Gregory XII in Rome. Following his election as pope, John spent a year in Bologna and then joined forces with [[Louis II of Anjou]] to march against Ladislaus. An initial victory proved short-lived and Ladislaus retook Rome in May 1413, forcing John to flee to Florence.&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; In Florence he met [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of the Romans. Sigismund wanted to end the schism and urged John to call a general council. John did so with hesitation, at first trying to have the council held in Italy (rather than in a German [[Free imperial city|Imperial City]], as Sigismund wanted). The [[Council of Constance]] was convened on 30 October 1413. During the third session, rival [[Pope Gregory XII]] authorized the council as well. The council resolved that all three popes should abdicate and a new pope be elected.&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1419.htm Miranda, Salvador. "Cossa, Baldassare", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flight from the Council of Constance ===
In March, John escaped from Constance disguised as a postman.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt; According to the Klingenberger Chronicle, written by a noble client of [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]], John XXIII travelled down the Rhine to Schaffhausen in a boat, while Frederick accompanied him with a small band of men on horseback. There was a huge outcry in Constance when it was discovered that John had fled, and Sigismund was furious about this setback to his plans for ending the Schism. The King of the Romans issued orders to all the powers on the Upper Rhine and in Swabia stating that he had declared Frederick to be an outlaw and that his lands and possessions were forfeit. In due course this led to a great deal of political upheaval and many Austrian losses in the region, notably in [[Aargau]] to the [[Swiss Confederation]].

In the meantime, AntiPope John XXIII and Frederick fled further downriver along the Rhine to the town of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], which recognised the duke of Austria as its lord. There Sigismund's lieutenant [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]] caught up with them. He convinced Frederick that he stood to lose too much by harbouring the fugitive pope, and the Austrian duke agreed to give himself and John up and return to Constance.&lt;ref&gt;Brandmüller, Walter. ''Das Konzil von Konstanz'', 1414–1418 (Paderborn, 1991){{ISBN?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deposition ===
During his absence John was deposed by the council, and upon his return he was tried for heresy, simony, schism and immorality, and found guilty on all counts. [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] wrote, "The more scandalous charges were suppressed; the vicar of Christ was accused only of [[piracy]], [[rape]], sodomy, murder and [[incest]]."&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', New York: The Heritage Press, 1946, vol. 3, p. 2417&lt;/ref&gt; John was given over to [[Ludwig III, Elector Palatine]], who imprisoned him for several months in [[Heidelberg]] and [[Mannheim]].
The last remaining claimant in Avignon, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], refused to resign and was excommunicated. [[Pope Martin V|Martin V]] was elected as new pope in 1417.

== Death and burial ==
[[File:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]].]]

Cossa was again imprisoned in Germany. He was freed in 1418 after a heavy ransom was paid by the Medici.&lt;ref name=mediateca/&gt; He went to Florence, where he submitted to Martin V, who made him [[Cardinal Bishop of Frascati]]. Cossa died only a few months later.

The Medici oversaw the construction of [[Tomb of Antipope John XXIII|his magnificent tomb]] by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] in the [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)|Battistero di San Giovanni]] in Florence. Pope Martin V protested in vain against the inscription on the sarcophagus: "John the former pope".

J.P. Kirsch remarks that "Undeniably secular and ambitious, his moral life was not above reproach, and his unscrupulous methods in no wise accorded with the requirements of his high office&amp;nbsp;... the heinous crimes of which his opponents in the council accused him were certainly gravely exaggerated."&lt;ref name=Kirsch/&gt; One historian concluded that John was "a great man in temporal things, but a complete failure and worthless in spiritual things".&lt;ref name=mccabe/&gt;

==Fictional depictions==
John is portrayed by [[Steven Waddington]] in the 2016 television series ''[[Medici: Masters of Florence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Medici: Masters of Florence|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5057130/|website=Internet Movie Database|access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
John is also a main character in ''[[A Trembling Upon Rome]]'' by [[Richard Condon]].

The 1932 thriller 'Safe Custody' by [[Dornford Yates]], references John. Listing the members of an objectionable family, a character in the story says:

"Then we come to his nephew—a promising lad of fifteen. He lies, steals, smells, assaults the servants and abuses any animal which he is satisfied will not retaliate. If Gibbon may be believed, Pope John the Twenty-third as a stripling must have resembled him".

Russian writer Dmitry Balashov wrote a novel "Baltazar Kossa" (Бальтазар Косса).

== Numbering issues ==
{{main|Pope John (numbering)}}
He should not be confused with [[Pope John XXIII]] of the twentieth century. When [[Pope John XXIII|Angelo Roncalli]] was elected pope in 1958, there was some confusion as to whether he would be ''John XXIII'' or ''John XXIV''; he then declared that he was John XXIII to put this question to rest. There was no [[Pope John XX|John XX]]; this is why Gibbon refers to the antipope John as John XXII.

The [[Federal city]] of '''Bonn''' ({{IPA-de|bɔn|-|De-Bonn.ogg}} {{lang-lat|Bonna}}) is a [[city]] on the banks of the [[Rhine]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], with a population of over 300,000. About {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Cologne]], Bonn is in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants. It is famously known as the birthplace of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in 1770 as well as the  [[capital city]] of [[West Germany]] until 1990.

Founded in the 1st century BC as the Roman settlement [[Germania Inferior]], Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the [[Electorate of Cologne]], and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of [[Archbishopric of Cologne|Cologne]]. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the [[Capital of Germany|capital]] of [[West Germany]], and Germany's present constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], was declared in the city in 1949. The era when Bonn served as the capital of West Germany is referred to by historians as the ''Bonn Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bonn Republic: West German Democracy, 1945–1990|author=Anthony James Nicholls|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1997|isbn=9780582492318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSvYAAAAIAAJ|via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government – but no longer capital – of [[German reunification|reunited Germany]].

==Geography==

{{wide image|General view over bonn.jpg|900px|View over central Bonn as seen from the Stadthaus, including the [[Siebengebirge]], a hill range on the east bank of the [[Middle Rhine]].|5=center}}

===Topography===
Situated in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area with over 11 million inhabitants, Bonn lies within the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], on the border with [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Spanning an area of more {{convert|141.2|km2|0|abbr=on}} on both sides of the river [[Rhine]], almost three-quarters of the city lies on the river's left bank.

To the south and to the west, Bonn is bordering the [[Eifel]] region which encompasses the [[Rhineland Nature Park]]. To the north, Bonn borders the [[Cologne Lowland]]. Natural borders are constituted by the river [[Sieg]] to the north-east and by the [[Siebengebirge]] (also known as the Seven Hills) to the east. The largest extension of the city in north–south dimensions is {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in west–east dimensions. The city borders have a total length of {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}}. The geographical centre of Bonn is the Bundeskanzlerplatz ''(Chancellor Square)'' in Bonn-Gronau.

=== Administration ===
The [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is divided into five [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk}}), and Bonn is part of the [[Regierungsbezirk Köln|governmental district of Cologne]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk Köln}}). Within this governmental district, the city of Bonn is an [[List of districts of Germany|urban district]] in its own right. The urban district of Bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts ({{lang-de|link=no|Stadtbezirk}}). These are Bonn, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Bonn-Beuel and Bonn-Hardtberg.
In 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and Beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.

== History ==

===Founding and Roman times===
{{see also|Timeline of Bonn}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
[[File:2008-12-25 Bonn Sterntor.jpg|left|thumb|The ''{{lang|de|Sterntor}}'', originally built around 1244, is a gate reconstructed on the remnants of the medieval city wall.]]
The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 12 BC, the [[Roman army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, "Bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]], the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, "Fort Bonn". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-5th century. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] kings until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The Sterntor (''star gate'') in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the "1st", i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].

[[File:Altes Rathaus Bonn.jpg|thumb|The ''Altes Rathaus'' (old town hall) as seen from the central market square. It was built in 1737 in [[Rococo]]-style.]]The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of Cologne and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne–Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, ''Bonna'', grew into a sizeable Roman town. Bonn is shown on the 4th century [[Peutinger Map]].

In [[late antiquity]], much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Franks|Franci]] chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from [[Saint Boniface]] via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*Bonnifatia'', but this proved to be a myth.

=== Middle Ages and Early Modern times ===
[[File:University bonn at night.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1818, the [[University of Bonn]] counts [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] among its alumni.]]
Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|Siege of Bonn]] in 1689. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Max Franz]] (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].

In 1794, the city was seized by French troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

===20th century and the "Bonn Republic"===
{{See also|Berlin-Bonn Act|Decision on the Capital of Germany}}

During the [[Second World War]], Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] captured the city during the battle of 8–9 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946|edition=Revised |year=2006|publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfDfAQAACAAJ|isbn=9780811701570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F013859-0009, Bonn, Staatsbesuch Präsident Charles de Gaulle.jpg|left|thumb|French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] on state visit to Bonn (1962), the capital of [[West Germany]] until [[German reunification]].]]

[[Aftermath of World War II|After]] the Second World War, Bonn was in the British zone of occupation. Following the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former Cologne Mayor and a native of that area, Bonn became the ''de facto'' capital, officially designated the "temporary seat of the Federal institutions," of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. However, the Bundestag, seated in Bonn's [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus]], affirmed [[Berlin]]'s status as the German capital. Bonn was chosen as the provisional capital and seat of government despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. Bonn was chosen because Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in West Germany for reunification.

In 1949, the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] in Bonn drafted and adopted the current German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. As the political centre of West Germany, Bonn saw six [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellors]] and six [[President of Germany|Presidents]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn's time as the capital of West Germany is commonly referred to as the ''Bonn Republic,'' in contrast to the ''Berlin Republic'' which followed reunification in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Schleichende Wende. Diskurse von Nation und Erinnerung bei der Konstituierung der Berliner Republik|last=Caborn|first=Joannah|language=de|publisher={{ill|Unrast Verlag|de}}|year=2006|isbn=9783897717398|pages=12|via=[[Google Books]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjNoAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bonn in the "Berlin Republic"===
[[File:Villa Hammerschmidt Bonn Seite Adenauerallee 20080831.jpg|left|thumb|Between 1950 and 1994, [[Hammerschmidt Villa|Villa Hammerschmidt]] was the primary official residence of the [[President of Germany]]. Today it serves as the President's secondary residence.]]
[[German reunification]] in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision, however, did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn – a situation roughly analogous to that of the [[Netherlands]], where [[Amsterdam]] is the capital but [[The Hague]] is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and more ominously with [[Nazi Germany]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to [[Brussels]], headquarters of the [[European Economic Community]]. Former chancellor and mayor of [[West Berlin]] [[Willy Brandt]] caused considerable offence to the Western Allies during the debate by stating that France would not have kept the seat of government at [[Vichy France|Vichy]] after Liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o36GDAAAQBAJ&amp;q=Willy+Brandt++France+Vichy+capital&amp;pg=PA149|title=Willy Brandt: a Political Biography|author=Barbara Marshall|date=18 December 1996|publisher=Springer|page=149|isbn=9780230390096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heated debate that [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|resulted]] was settled by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338–320,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20110615/35655|title=Bonn to Berlin move still controversial|work=The Local|date=15 June 2011|access-date=1 December 2020|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin. The vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring Bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nationalatlas aktuell|url=http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|website=Hauptstadtbeschluss|author=Sebastian Lentz|date=17 June 2011|access-date=20 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331093254/http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|archive-date=31 March 2013|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laux|first=Hans-Dieter|title=Berlin oder Bonn? Geographische Aspekte eine Parlamentsentscheidung|journal=Geographische Rundschau|volume=43|issue=12|pages=740–743|year=1991|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also broke along generational lines as well; older legislators with memories of Berlin's past glory favoured Berlin, while younger legislators favoured Bonn. Ultimately, the votes of the [[New states of Germany#Culture|eastern German]] legislators tipped the balance in favour of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government of reunited Germany. In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of Federal City ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesstadt}}). Bonn currently shares the status of Germany's seat of government with Berlin, with the [[President of Germany|President]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] and many government ministries (such as [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Food &amp; Agriculture]] and [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence]]) maintaining large presences in Bonn. Over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in Bonn.&lt;ref name="Cowell"/&gt; A total of 19 United Nations (UN) institutions operate from Bonn today.

==Politics==
[[File:Ashok Alexander Sridharan, Oberbürgermeister Bonn.jpg|thumb|Ashok Alexander Sridharan [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|(CDU)]] was the mayor of Bonn from 2015 until 2020.]]

=== City council ===
The [[city council]] of Bonn used to be based in the [[Rococo]]-style and 1737 built ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'' (old city hall) adjacent to Bonn's central market square. However, due to the enlargement of Bonn in 1969 through the incorporation of Beuel and Bad Godesberg, it moved into the larger Stadthaus facilities further up north. This was necessary for the city council to accommodate the increased number of representatives. The mayor of Bonn still sits in the ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'', which is also used for representative and official purposes.

As of the 2020–2025 election cycle, the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democrats (CDU)]] and the [[Alliance 90/The Greens|Greens (Bündnis'90/Die Grünen)]] hold 17 seats respectively, followed by the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats (SPD)]] with 11 seats, the local Bürgerbund Bonn with 5 seats, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Liberals (FDP)]] and Volt with 3 seats respectively, the [[The Left (Germany)|Left (Die Linke)]] with 4 seats, , the [[Alternative for Germany]] (AfD) with 2 seats, and independent candidates with a total of 4 seats. There are currently 66 seats in the city council of Bonn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Rat. Ausschüsse.|url=https://www.bonn.de/service-bieten/stadtpolitik-ortsrecht/rat-ausschuesse.php|access-date=2021-01-18|website=Bundesstadt Bonn|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stadthaus-01-04-2013-133.jpg|thumb|The ''{{lang|de|Stadthaus}}'', home of the city council of Bonn.]]
The mayor is [[Katja Dörner]] (Bündnis '90/Die Grünen), elected in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://rp-online.de/nrw/kommunalwahl/ergebnis-stichwahl-bonn-2020-gruene-katja-doerner-wird-oberbuergermeisterin_aid-53552801 |title= Bonn wird grün - Katja Dörner gewinnt Stichwahl |last=Germany|first=RP Media|website=rp-online.de|access-date=2 October 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landtag election ===
Four delegates represent the Federal city of Bonn in the [[Landtag]] of [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The last election took place in May 2017. The current delegates are Guido Déus ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]), Christos Katzidis (CDU), Joachim Stamp [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|(FDP)]] and Franziska Müller-Rech (FDP).

=== German federal election ===
Bonn's [[Electoral district|constituency]] is called ''{{lang|de|Bundeswahlkreis Bonn}}'' (096). In the [[German federal election, 2017|German federal election 2017]], [[Ulrich Kelber]] [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|(SPD)]] was elected a member of [[Bundestag|German Federal parliament, the Bundestag]] by direct mandate. It is his fifth term. [[Katja Dörner]] representing Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and [[Alexander Graf Lambsdorff]] for [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] were eleceted as well. Kelber resigned in 2019 because he was appointed [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]]. As Dörner was elected Lord Mayer of Bonn in September 2020, she resigned as a member of parliament after her entry into office.

== Culture ==
Beethoven's birthplace is located in Bonngasse near the market place. Next to the market place is the Old City Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It is used for receptions of guests of the city, and as an office for the mayor. Nearby is the ''[[Electoral Palace, Bonn|Kurfürstliches Schloss]]'', built as a residence for the prince-elector and now the main building of the [[University of Bonn]]. 
[[File:Bonner Münster.jpg|thumb|Erected in the 11th and 13th century, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bonn Minster|Minster of Bonn]] is one of Germany's oldest churches.]]
The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'' is an avenue flanked by [[Chestnut]] trees which had the first [[horsecar]] of the city. It connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''[[Poppelsdorfer Schloss]]'', a palace that was built as a resort for the prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century, and whose grounds are now a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Bonn]]). This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], a building erected in 1883/84.

The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] stands on the Münsterplatz, which is flanked by the [[Bonn Minster]], one of Germany's oldest churches.

The three highest structures in the city are the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] in Bonn-Venusberg ({{convert|180|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' ({{convert|162.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' ({{convert|114.7|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) now the location of the UN Campus.

Just as Bonn's other four major museums, the ''[[Haus der Geschichte]]'' or Museum of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany, is located on the so-called ''Museumsmeile'' ("Museum Mile")''.'' The Haus der Geschichte is one of the foremost German museums of contemporary German history, with branches in [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]]. In its permanent exhibition, the Haus der Geschichte presents German history from 1945 until the present, also shedding light on Bonn's own role as former capital of West Germany. Numerous temporary exhibitions emphasize different features, such as Nazism or important personalities in German history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdg.de/index.php?id=1&amp;L=1|title=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Home|date=13 June 2008|publisher=Hdg.de|access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kunstmuseum Bonn]]'' or Bonn Museum of Modern Art is an art museum founded in 1947. The Kunstmuseum exhibits both temporary exhibitions and its permanent collection. The latter is focused on Rhenish [[Expressionism]] and post-war German art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kunstmuseum.bonn.de/start_e.htm |title=Kunstmuseum Bonn – Overview |publisher=Kunstmuseum.bonn.de |date=n.d.|access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; German artists on display include [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Blinky Palermo]] and [[Wolf Vostell]]. The museum owns one of the largest collections of artwork by Expressionist painter [[August Macke]]. His work is also on display in the [[August-Macke-Haus]], located in Macke's former home where he lived from 1911 to 1914.
[[File:2014-06-12 Museum Koenig, Bonn IMG 5509.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Museum Koenig]] is Bonn's [[natural history]] museum. ]]
The [[Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland|''Bundeskunsthalle'']] (full name: Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland or Art and Exhibition Hall of the Federal Republic of Germany), focuses on the crossroads of culture, arts, and science.

The ''[[Museum Koenig]]'' is Bonn's natural history museum. Affiliated with the [[University of Bonn]], it is also a [[Zoology|zoological]] research institution housing the ''Leibniz-Institut für Biodiversität der Tiere''. Politically interesting, it is on the premises of the Museum Koenig where the [[Parlamentarischer Rat]] first met.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Museum Koenig]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Deutsches Museum Bonn]]'', affiliated with one of the world's foremost science museums, the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, is an interactive science museum focusing on post-war German scientists, engineers, and inventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museumsmeilebonn.de/portfolio/deutsches-museum-bonn/|title=MUSEUMSMEILE BONN|website=museumsmeilebonn.de|language=de-DE|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other museums include the [[Beethoven House]], birthplace of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fraunhofer-Institut für Medienkommunikation IMK |url=http://www.beethoven-haus-bonn.de/sixcms/detail.php//portal_en |title=Beethoven digitally |publisher=Beethoven-haus-bonn.de |date=26 March 2002 |access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn]] (Rhinish Regional Museum Bonn),&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bonn Women's Museum]], the [[Rheinisches Malermuseum]] and the [[Arithmeum]].

[[File:Siebengebirge schloss drachenburg ds wv 09 2008.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Schloss Drachenburg|Drachenburg Castle]] in the [[Siebengebirge]] south of Bonn.]]
There are several parks, leisure and protected areas in and around Bonn. The ''{{ill|Rheinaue|de}}'' is Bonn's most important leisure park, with its role being comparable to what [[Central Park]] is for New York City. It lies on the banks of the Rhine and is the city's biggest park intra muros.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Freizeitpark Rheinaue]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rhine promenade and the ''Alter Zoll'' (Old Toll Station) are in direct neighbourhood of the city centre and are popular amongst both residents and visitors. The ''[[Arboretum Park Härle]]'' is an [[arboretum]] with specimens dating to back to 1870. The ''[[Botanical Garden, Bonn|Botanischer Garten]]'' (Botanical Garden) is affiliated with the university and it is here where [[Titan arum]] set a world record.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Botanischer Garten Bonn]]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural reserve of ''[[Kottenforst]]'' is a large area of protected woods on the hills west of the city centre. It is about {{convert|40|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} in area and part of the [[Rhineland Nature Park]] ({{convert|1045|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Kottenforst]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the very south of the city, on the border with [[Wachtberg]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], there is an extinct volcano, the [[Rodderberg]], featuring a popular area for hikes. Also south of the city, there is the [[Siebengebirge]] which is part of the lower half of the [[Middle Rhine]] region. The nearby upper half of the [[Middle Rhine]] from [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] to [[Koblenz]] is a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the [[Middle Ages]] and important German vineyards.

=== Air traffic ===
[[File:Koeln-Bonn-Airport11.JPG|thumb|upright=0.85|The [[Cologne Bonn Airport|international airport of Cologne and Bonn]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]: CGN) is Germany's [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|seventh-largest]].]]
Named after [[Konrad Adenauer]], the first post-war Chancellor of West Germany, [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] is situated {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} north-east from the city centre of Bonn. With around 10.3&amp;nbsp;million passengers passing through it in 2015, it is the [[List of the busiest airports in Germany|seventh-largest passenger airport in Germany]] and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations. By traffic units, which combines cargo and passengers, the airport is in fifth position in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204205/http://www.adv.aero/fileadmin/pdf/statistiken/2015/11.2015_ADV-Monatsstatistik.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, Cologne Bonn Airport had services to 115 passenger destinations in 35 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/sommerflugplan-2015-sieben-ziele-flughafen-koeln-bonn/35295|title=Sommerflugplan 2015: Sieben neue Ziele ab Flughafen Köln/Bonn|work=airliners.de|access-date=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is one of Germany's few 24-hour airports, and is a hub for [[Eurowings]] and cargo operators [[FedEx Express]] and [[UPS Airlines]].

The federal motorway (''Autobahn'') [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] connects the airport with the city. Long distance and regional trains to and from the airport stop at [[Cologne/Bonn Airport station]]. Other major airports within a one-hour drive by car are [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankurt International Airport]] and [[Düsseldorf Airport|Düsseldorf International Airport]].

=== Rail and bus system ===
[[File:2008-07-28 U-Bahnhof Hauptbahnhof (Bonn).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], Bonn's busiest railway station, is connected to Bonn's partly underground [[U-Bahn]] network.]]
Bonn's central railway station, [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], serves urban ([[S-train|S-Bahn]], [[U-Bahn]], sharing the same network with the neighbouring city of Cologne), regional ([[Regionalbahn]]), and long-distance destinations ([[Intercity-Express|ICE]]) such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Zurich, Vienna, Brussels, Amsterdam and Paris. Daily, more than 67,000 people travel via Bonn Hauptbahnhof. In late 2016, around 80 long distance and more than 165 regional trains departed to or from Bonn every day.&lt;ref name="general041116"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Sanierung-geht-in-die-heiße-Phase-article3397749.html|title=Sanierung geht in die heiße Phase|work=[[General-Anzeiger (Bonn)|General-Anzeiger]]|date=4 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105205334/http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/Sanierung-geht-in-die-hei%C3%9Fe-Phase-article3397749.html|archive-date=5 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ga.de"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ga.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/der-hauptbahnhof-bonn-wird-saniert_aid-43091427|work=[[General-Anzeiger (Bonn)|General-Anzeiger]]|date=12 May 2017|title=Der Hauptbahnhof Bonn wird saniert|trans-title=Bonn Central Station is being renovated|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201201160203/https://ga.de/bonn/stadt-bonn/der-hauptbahnhof-bonn-wird-saniert_aid-43091427|archive-date=1 December 2020|language=de|author=Bettina Köhl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="db041116"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/presse/duesseldorf/de/aktuell/presseinformationen/12647934/161107_schoene_aussichten.html|title=Schöne Aussichten im Hauptbahnhof Bonn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106105046/http://www.deutschebahn.com/presse/duesseldorf/de/aktuell/presseinformationen/12647934/161107_schoene_aussichten.html|archive-date=6 November 2016|website=Deutsche Bahn|date=4 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other major railway station ([[Siegburg/Bonn station|Siegburg/Bonn]]) lies on the [[Köln–Frankfurt high-speed rail line|high-speed rail line between Cologne and Frankfurt]].

The bus system of Bonn is composed of roughly 30 lines which operate on a regular basis. During peaks, buses usually run every 5 minutes; off-peak buses run every 20 minutes. Several lines offer night services, especially during the weekends. Bonn is part of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg]] (''Rhine-Sieg Transport Association'') which is the public transport association covering the area of the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]].

=== Road network ===
[[File:Region Bonn motorways.png|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Road network adjacent to Bonn.]]
Four [[Autobahn]]s run through or are adjacent to Bonn: the [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] (right bank of the Rhine, connecting Bonn with [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]]), the [[Bundesautobahn 555|A555]] (left bank of the [[Rhine]], connecting Bonn with Cologne), the [[Bundesautobahn 562|A562]] (connecting the right with the left bank of the Rhine south of Bonn), and the [[Bundesautobahn 565|A565]] (connecting the A59 and the A555 with the [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] to the southwest). Three Bundesstraßen, which have a general {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=off}} [[speed limit]] in contrast to the Autobahn, connect Bonn to its immediate surroundings (Bundesstraßen B9, B42 and B56).

With Bonn being divided into two parts by the [[Rhine]], three bridges are crucial for inner-city road traffic: the Konrad-Adenauer-Brücke (A562), the Friedrich-Ebert-Brücke (A565), and the Kennedybrücke (B56). In addition, regular ferries operate between Bonn-Mehlem and [[Königswinter]], Bonn-Bad Godesberg and [[Niederdollendorf]], and Graurheindorf and Mondorf.

=== Port ===
Located in the northern sub-district of Graurheindorf, the [[Inland harbor|inland harbour]] of Bonn is used for container traffic as well as oversea transport. The annual turnover amounts to around {{convert|500000|t||abbr=on}}. Regular passenger transport occurs to Cologne and Düsseldorf.

==Sports==
Bonn is home of the [[Telekom Baskets Bonn]], the only basketball club in Germany that owns its arena, the [[Telekom Dome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telekom-baskets-bonn.de/telekom-dome/uebersicht.html "Telekom Baskets Bonn – Telekom Dome – Übersicht"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012040651/http://www.telekom-baskets-bonn.de/telekom-dome/uebersicht.html |date=12 October 2013 }}, ''Telekom-Baskets-Bonn.de''. Retrieved 8 March 2014. {{in lang|de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club is a regular participant at international competitions such as the [[Basketball Champions League]].

The city also has a semi-professional football team [[Bonner SC]] which was formed in 1965 through the merger of ''Bonner FV'' and ''Tura Bonn''. The Bonn Gamecocks American football team play at the 12,000-capacity Stadion Pennenfeld.

The headquarters of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] has been located in Bonn since 1999.

==International relations==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Since 1983, the City of Bonn has established friendship relations with the City of [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, and since 1988 Bonn, in former times the residence of the Princes Electors of Cologne, and [[Potsdam]], Germany, the formerly most important residential city of the Prussian rulers, have established a city-to-city partnership.

Central Bonn is surrounded by a number of traditional towns and villages which were independent up to several decades ago. As many of those communities had already established their own contacts and partnerships before the regional and local reorganisation in 1969, the Federal City of Bonn now has a dense network of city district partnerships with European partner towns.

The city district of Bonn is a partner of the English university city of [[Oxford]], England, UK (since 1947), of [[Budafok]], District XXII of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (since 1991) and of [[Opole]], [[Poland]] (officially since 1997; contacts were established 1954).

The district of Bad Godesberg has established partnerships with [[Saint-Cloud]] in France, [[Frascati]] in Italy, [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|Windsor and Maidenhead]] in England, UK and [[Kortrijk]] in Belgium; a friendship agreement has been signed with the town of [[Yalova]], Turkey.

The district of Beuel on the right bank of the Rhine and the city district of Hardtberg foster partnerships with towns in France: [[Mirecourt]] and [[Villemomble]].

Moreover, the city of Bonn has developed a concept of international co-operation and maintains sustainability oriented project partnerships in addition to traditional city twinning, among others with [[Minsk]] in Belarus, [[Ulaanbaatar]] in Mongolia, [[Bukhara]] in Uzbekistan, [[Chengdu]] in China and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia.

Berlin straddles the banks of the [[River Spree]], which flows into the [[River Havel]] (a [[tributary]] of the [[River Elbe]]) in the western borough of [[Spandau]]. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree, Havel, and [[Dahme (river)|Dahme]] rivers (the largest of which is [[Lake Müggelsee]]). Due to its location in the [[European Plain]], Berlin is influenced by a [[Temperate climate|temperate seasonal climate]]. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94LP4xCb-KcC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Gren Berlin|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|access-date=9 October 2009|isbn=9781740594721|last1=Schulte-Peevers|first1=Andrea|last2=Parkinson|first2=Tom|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city lies in the [[Central German]] dialect area, the [[Berlin dialect]] being a variant of the [[Lusatian-New Marchian dialects]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin}}
{{Further|Timeline of Berlin}}

===Etymology===
Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River [[Elbe]], that once constituted, together with the River (Saxon or Thuringian) [[Saale]] (from their [[confluence]] at [[Barby, Germany|Barby]] onwards), the eastern border of the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]]. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''Bär'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting arm]].

Of Berlin's [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|twelve boroughs]], five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Pankow]] (the most populous), [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Treptow-Köpenick]] and [[Spandau]] (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[Lübars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schmöckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. The neighborhood of [[Moabit]] bears a [[French language|French]]-derived name, and [[Französisch Buchholz]] is named after the [[Huguenots]].

[[Cölln]] on the [[Fischerinsel]] is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the [[Spree]] in what is now called the [[Nikolaiviertel]], is referenced in a document from 1244.&lt;ref name="zycwaq"/&gt; 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.&lt;ref name=Medtradc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/en/history/the-medieval-trading-center/ |title=The medieval trading center |access-date=11 June 2013 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co.

In 1415, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty |publisher=Antipas |year=1993 |access-date=18 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archive-date=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of [[Prussia]], and eventually as [[German emperor]]s. In 1443, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html |title=Berliner Unwillen |trans-title=Berlin unwillingness |publisher=Verein für die Geschichte Berlins e.&amp;nbsp;V. |first=Gerhild H.

After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector [[Albrecht III Achilles, Elector of Brandenburg|Albrecht III Achilles]], Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence.&lt;ref name="Lui stadtgr"/&gt; Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg|John Cicero]] came to power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/en/history/the-electors-residence/ |title=The electors' residence |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co.

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years.]]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]], crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Horlemann, Bernd (Hrsg.), Mende, Hans-Jürgen (Hrsg.): Berlin 1994. Taschenkalender. Edition Luisenstadt Berlin, Nr. 01280.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Königsberg]]. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".&lt;ref name="Stöver2010"/&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin.

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref name="HollandGawthrop2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Holland|author2=John Gawthrop|title=The Rough Guide to Berlin|url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoberl00holl|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-682-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetoberl00holl/page/361 361]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fields such as [[architecture]], [[painting]] and [[film|cinema]] new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{cvt|66|to|883|km2}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Nazis came to power|came to power]]. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450|title=The Jewish Community of Berlin|publisher=Holocuast Encyclopedia |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed during {{Dash year|1943|1945}} Allied air raids and the 1945 [[Battle of Berlin]].

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39619/das-geteilte-berlin?p=all |title=Berlin – auf dem Weg zur geteilten Stadt |trans-title=Berlin – on the way to a divided city |date=27 April 2005 |first=Prof. Dr. Wolfgang |last=Benz |language=de |publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.]]

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move the western powers did not recognize. East Berlin included most of the city's historic centre. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html |title=Berlin after 1945 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co. KG. |access-date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, East Germany began to build the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" speech in 1963, underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm |title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971 |publisher=U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany |year=1996 |access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|Berlin Wall fell]] on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became a reunified city. [[Walter Momper]], the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city in the interim. City-wide elections in December 1990 resulted in the first "all Berlin" mayor being elected to take office in January 1991, with the separate offices of mayors in East and West Berlin expiring by that time, and [[Eberhard Diepgen]] (a former mayor of West Berlin) became the first elected mayor of a reunited Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/world/berlin-mayoral-contest-has-many-uncertainties.html |title=Berlin Mayoral Contest Has Many Uncertainties |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 December 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of allied occupation troops allowing a [[German reunification#Reunified Berlin|reunified Berlin]]&lt;ref name=ReUnificationParade&gt;{{cite news | last=Kinzer | first=Stephan | title=Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | location=New York City | date=19 June 1994 | access-date=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the last Russian troops departed on 31 August, while the final departure of Western Allies forces was on 8 September 1994).

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Berlin}}

===Topography===
[[File:Berlin by Senitnel-2.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Berlin]]

Berlin is in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=Google Maps|access-date=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the Arkenberge hills in Pankow at {{convert|122|m|abbr=off}} elevation, have been the highest point in Berlin. Through the disposal of construction debris they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{cvt|120.1|m|disp=or}}), which itself was made up of rubble from the ruins of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |title=Berlin hat eine neue Spitze |trans-title=Berlin has a new top |first=Nikolaus |last=Triantafillou |access-date=11 November 2018 |language=de |publisher=Qiez |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|abbr=off}} elevation is the highest natural point and the lowest is the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|abbr=off}} elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |title=Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow |trans-title=The tallest mountain in Berlin is now in Pankow |date=22 February 2015 |access-date=22 February 2015 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |first=Stefan |last=Jacobs |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.]]

Due to its transitional climate zones, frosts are common in winter and there are larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many [[oceanic climate]]s. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[Humid continental climate|continental climate]] (''Dc'') under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha climate scheme]], as well as the suburbs of [[New York City|New York]], although the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]] puts them in different types.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstengarbe FW, Werner PC (2009) A short update on Koeppen climate shifts in Europe between 1901 and 2003.

Berlin's history has left the city with a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today has been predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history during the 20th century. All of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 2nd German Empire of 1871, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, as well as the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raids]], fires and street battles during the Second World War, and many of the buildings that had survived in both East and West, were demolished during the post-war period. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new business or residential districts and the main arteries. Much [[Ornament (art)|ornamentation]] on pre-war buildings was destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]], and in both post-war systems, as well as in the reunified Berlin, many important heritage structures have been [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' along with, the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the monumental buildings on [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and also the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings have been inspired by their historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|towers]] rise at various locations: [[Potsdamer Platz]], the [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two delineating the former centers of East and West Berlin, with the first representing a new Berlin of the 21st century, risen from the wastes of no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

Over one-third of the city area consists of green space, woodlands and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.berlin.de/senuvk/umwelt/stadtgruen/gruenanlagen/de/daten_fakten/downloads/ausw_5.pdf|author=Senatsverwaltung für Umwelt, Verkehr und Klimaschutz Berlin, Referat Freiraumplanung und Stadtgrün|title=Anteil öffentlicher Grünflächen in Berlin|access-date=2020-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin's second largest and most popular park, the [[Großer Tiergarten]], is located right in the center of the city. It covers an area of 210 hectares and stretches from [[Bahnhof Zoo]] in the City West to the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in the east.

In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[personification]]s of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.

The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.
[[File:Bikinihaus Berlin-1210760.jpg|thumb|[[Breitscheidplatz]] with [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] is the centre of [[City West]].]]
[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990 |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |access-date=18 August 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610103008/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |archive-date=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html |title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable |work=The New York Times |access-date=18 August 2008 |first=Nicolai |last=Ouroussoff |date=9 May 2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east–west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Berlin Victory Column|Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{cvt|55|m}} and an observation deck {{cvt|126|m}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] over the Spree river is Berlin's most iconic bridge, connecting the now-combined boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It carries vehicles, pedestrians, and the U1 [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line. The bridge was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896, replacing the former wooden bridge, with an upper deck for the U-Bahn. The center portion was demolished in 1945 to stop the [[Red Army]] from crossing. After the war, the repaired bridge served as a [[Berlin border crossings|checkpoint and border crossing]] between the Soviet and American sectors, and later between East and West Berlin. In the mid-1950s it was closed to vehicles, and after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, pedestrian traffic was heavily restricted. Following German reunification, the center portion was reconstructed with a steel frame, and U-Bahn service resumed in 1995.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, after the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Berlin is home to at least 180,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,&lt;ref name="pop-detail"/&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dmitry Bulgakov |url=http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |title=Berlin is speaking Russians' language |publisher=Russiajournal.com |date=11 March 2001 |access-date=10 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406142034/http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |archive-date=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article616463/Berlin_wird_farbiger_Die_Afrikaner_kommen.html |title=Berlin wird farbiger.

===Languages===
{{Main|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
[[German language|German]] is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |access-date=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects]]. It is spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Brandenburgisch dialect|Brandenburgish]] variant. The dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, Polish, English, Arabic, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Romanian, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, French, Spanish and Vietnamese. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish and Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. Polish, English, Russian, and Vietnamese have more native speakers in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |title=Studie – Zwei Millionen Berliner sprechen mindestens zwei Sprachen – Wirtschaft – Berliner Morgenpost – Berlin |publisher=Morgenpost.de |date=18 May 2010 |access-date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2011 census, approximately 37 percent of the population reported being members of a legally-recognized church or religious organization. The rest either did not belong to such an organization, or there was no information available about them.&lt;ref name="Census 2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zensus 2011 – Bevölkerung und Haushalte – Bundesland Berlin|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|website=[[Amt für Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg]]|pages=6–7|access-date=23 February 2019|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193809/https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/zensus/gdb/bev/be/11_Berlin_bev.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City state===
[[File:Rotes_Rathaus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rotes Rathaus]] (''Red City Hall''), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin]]
Since [[German reunification|reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]] among the present 16 states of Germany. The [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') functions as the city and state parliament, which has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to ten senators holding ministerial positions, two of them holding the title of "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2016-11-01|title=Verfassung von Berlin - Abschnitt IV: Die Regierung|url=https://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/regierender-buergermeister/verfassung/artikel.41527.php|access-date=2020-10-02|website=www.berlin.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/berliner-haushalt-finanzsenator-bleibt-trotz-sprudelnder-steuereinnahmen-vorsichtig-24702234|title=Berliner Haushalt Finanzsenator bleibt trotz sprudelnder Steuereinnahmen vorsichtig |work=Berliner Zeitung |access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state owns extensive assets, including administrative and government buildings, real estate companies, as well as stakes in the Olympic Stadium, swimming pools, housing companies, and numerous public enterprises and subsidiary companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2019|title=Vermögen |trans-title=Assets |url=https://www.berlin.de/sen/finanzen/de-plain/vermoegen/artikel.92737.de-plain.php|date=18 May 2017|website=[[Berlin.de]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2019|title=Beteiligungen des Landes Berlin|trans-title=Holdings of the State of Berlin |url=https://www.berlin.de/sen/finanzen/vermoegen/beteiligungen/artikel.7208.php|language=de |date=5 September 2019|website=[[Berlin.de]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |title=Berlin state election, 2006 |website=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin |access-date=17 August 2008 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323161037/https://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |archive-date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Berlin state election, 2016|2016 state election]], there has been a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party.

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Minister President of the State of Berlin (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of the Governing Mayor is in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]].

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's 12 boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough has a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin.&lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |access-date=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin's official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities/&gt;

Public transportation in Berlin has a long and complicated history because of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century division of the city, where movement between the two halves was not served. Since [[1989]], the transport network has been developed extensively; however, it still contains early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century traits, such as the U1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wolf, Winfried.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33163088|title=Berlin, Weltstadt ohne Auto? : Verkehrsgeschichte 1848-2015|date=1994|publisher=ISP|isbn=3-929008-74-2|edition=1.

Berlin is served by one commercial international airport: [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] (BER), located just outside Berlin's south-eastern border, in the state of Brandenburg. It began construction in 2006, with the intention of replacing [[Berlin Tegel Airport|{{lang|de|Tegel|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (TXL) and [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|{{lang|de|Schönefeld|nocat=y|italic=no}} Airport]] (SXF) as the single commercial airport of Berlin.&lt;ref name="BBC 2018-11-06"&gt;{{cite web|first=Emily|last=Schultheis|date=6 November 2018|access-date=23 May 2019|title=Whatever happened to Berlin's deserted 'ghost' airport?|url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport|website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously set to open in 2012, after extensive delays and cost overruns, it opened for commercial operations in October 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Berlin's new $7 billion airport has finally opened after 9 years of delays, corruption allegations, and construction woes— see inside |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/berlin-brandenburg-airport-finally-opens-after-9-years-of-delays-2020-11?r=US&amp;IR=T |website=Business Insider |publisher=Business Insider |access-date=9 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned initial capacity of around 27&amp;nbsp;million passengers per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=23 May 2019 |title=Airport Berlin Brandenburg BER |url=https://www.berlin.de/en/airports-and-stations/1872865-2932875-airport-berlin-brandenburg-ber.en.html |website=berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to be further developed to bring the terminal capacity to approximately 55&amp;nbsp;million per year by 2040.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|access-date=23 May 2019 |title=BER: A brief history of how not to build an airport |url=https://www.tip-berlin.de/ber-a-brief-history-of-how-not-to-build-an-airport/ |date=24 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the opening of the BER in Brandenburg, Berlin was served by Tegel Airport and Schönefeld Airport. Tegel Airport was within the city limits, and Schönefeld Airport was located at the same site as the BER. Both airports together handled 29.5&amp;nbsp;million passengers in 2015. In 2014, 67 airlines served 163 destinations in 50 countries from Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |title=2014 summer flight schedule |website=FBB |access-date=10 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911063838/http://www.berlin-airport.de/en/press/press-releases/2014/2014-03-28-summer-flight-schedule/index.php |archive-date=11 September 2014 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|de|Tegel|italic=no}} Airport was a focus city for [[Lufthansa]] and [[Eurowings]] while Schönefeld served as an important destination for airlines like {{lang|de|[[Germania (airline)|Germania]]|italic=no}}, [[easyJet]] and [[Ryanair]]. Until 2008, Berlin was also served by the smaller [[Tempelhof Airport]], which functioned as a city airport, with a convenient location near the city centre allowing for quick transit times between the central business district and the airport.

====Cycling====
{{Main|Cycling in Berlin}}

Berlin is well known for its highly developed bicycle lane system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/07/bike_city_berli.php |title=Bike City Berlin |website=Treehugger |access-date=19 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated Berlin has 710 bicycles per 1000 residents. Around 500,000 daily bike riders accounted for 13% of total traffic in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/193840.platz-da-8211-fuer-die-radfahrer.html |title=Platz da! – für die Radfahrer |website=Neues Deutschland |access-date=22 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyclists have access to {{cvt|620|km|0}} of bicycle paths including approximately {{cvt|150|km|0}} of mandatory bicycle paths, {{cvt|190|km|0}} of off-road bicycle routes, {{cvt|60|km|0}} of bicycle lanes on roads, {{cvt|70|km|0}} of shared bus lanes which are also open to cyclists, {{cvt|100|km|0}} of combined pedestrian/bike paths and {{cvt|50|km|0}} of marked bicycle lanes on roadside pavements (or sidewalks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/politik_planung/zahlen_fakten/download/Mobility_en_komplett.pdf |title=Berlin Traffic in Figures |website=Senate Department of Urban Development |year=2013 |access-date=14 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319085713/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/politik_planung/zahlen_fakten/download/Mobility_en_komplett.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riders are allowed to carry their bicycles on {{lang|de|[[Regionalbahn]]|italic=no}}, S-Bahn and U-Bahn trains, on trams, and on night buses if a bike ticket is purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/verkehr/mobil/fahrrad/bus_bahn/ |title=Mit dem Fahrrad – In Bussen und Bahnen |trans-title=By Bicycle – In Buses and Trains |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |language=de |access-date=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rohrpost (pneumatic postal network)====
{{Main|Rohrpost in Berlin}}
From 1865 until 1976 Berlin had an extensive [[Pneumatic tube|pneumatic postal network]], which at its peak in 1940, totalled 400 kilometres length. After 1949 the system was split in two separated networks. The West Berlin system in operation and open for public use until 1963, and for government use until 1972. The East Berlin system which inherited the ''Hauptelegraphenamt'', the central hub of the system, was in operation until 1976

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Heizkraftwerk Mitte power plant]]

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and the Berlin-based company [[GASAG]]. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [[Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|title=European Green City Index Berlin Germany|website=Siemens|year=2009|access-date=19 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913113150/https://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|archive-date=13 September 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}} the five [[List of power stations in Germany|largest power plants measured by capacity]] are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [[power station]]s generate [[electricity generation|electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Berlin is home to 44 theaters and stages.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; The [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Mitte was built in 1849–50 and has operated almost continuously since then. The [[Volksbühne]] at [[Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz]] was built in 1913–14, though the company had been founded in 1890. The [[Berliner Ensemble]], famous for performing the works of [[Bertolt Brecht]], was established in 1949. The [[Schaubühne]] was founded in 1962 and moved to the building of the former Universum Cinema on Kurfürstendamm in 1981. With a [[seating capacity]] of 1,895 and a stage floor of {{convert|2854|m2|0|abbr=off}}, the [[Friedrichstadt-Palast]] in Berlin Mitte is the largest show palace in Europe.

Berlin has three major [[opera house]]s: the [[Deutsche Oper]], the [[Berlin State Opera]], and the [[Komische Oper]]. The Berlin State Opera on [[Unter den Linden]] opened in 1742 and is the oldest of the three. Its musical director is [[Daniel Barenboim]]. The Komische Oper has traditionally specialized in [[operetta]]s and is also at Unter den Linden. The Deutsche Oper opened in 1912 in Charlottenburg.

The city's main venue for musical theater performances are the Theater am Potsdamer Platz and [[Theater des Westens]] (built in 1895). Contemporary dance can be seen at the ''Radialsystem V''. The [[Tempodrom]] is host to concerts and circus inspired entertainment. It also houses a multi-sensory spa experience. The [[Admiralspalast]] in Mitte has a vibrant program of [[variety show|variety]] and music events.

There are seven symphony orchestras in Berlin.

Many local foods originated from north German culinary traditions and include rustic and hearty dishes with pork, goose, fish, peas, beans, cucumbers, or potatoes. Typical Berliner fare include popular [[street food]] like the ''[[Currywurst]]'' (which gained popularity with post-war construction workers rebuilding the city), ''[[Frikadeller|Buletten]]'' and the ''[[Berliner (doughnut)|Berliner]]'' doughnut, known in Berlin as {{lang|de|Pfannkuchen}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germanfoods.org/consumer/facts/berlin.cfm Berlin] German Foods&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/spicy-sausage-that-is-worthy-of-a-shrine-in-berlin-1772530.html|title=Spicy sausage that is worthy of a shrine in Berlin|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|first=Tony|last=Paterson|date=15 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; German bakeries offering a variety of breads and pastries are widespread.

Berlin is also home to a diverse gastronomy scene reflecting the immigrant history of the city. Turkish and Arab immigrants brought their culinary traditions to the city, such as the [[lahmajoun]] and [[falafel]], which have become common fast food staples. The modern fast food version of the [[doner kebab]] sandwich which [[Kadir Nurman|evolved in Berlin]] in the 1970s, has since become a favorite dish in Germany and elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304432704577350194262835880| title=There's Nothing More German Than a Big, Fat Juicy Döner Kebab| author=James Angelos| date=18 April 2012| newspaper=The Wall Street Journal| access-date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asian cuisine like Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Korean, and Japanese restaurants, as well as Spanish tapas bars, Italian, and Greek cuisine, can be found in many parts of the city.

A '''bicycle''', also called a '''bike''' or '''cycle''', is a [[human-powered transport|human-powered]] or [[motorized bicycle|motor-powered]], [[bicycle pedal|pedal-driven]], [[single-track vehicle]], having two [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] attached to a [[bicycle frame|frame]], one behind the other. A {{vanchor|bicycle rider|BICYCLE_RIDER}} is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe, and by the early 21st century, more than 1&amp;nbsp;billion were in existence at a given time.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of individual models produced.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; They are the principal [[means of transportation]] in many regions. They also provide a popular form of [[recreation]], and have been adapted for use as children's toys, [[Physical fitness|general fitness]], military and police applications, [[courier services]], [[bicycle racing]], and bicycle stunts.

The basic shape and configuration of a typical [[Safety bicycle|upright or "safety bicycle"]], has changed little since the first [[Chain drive|chain-driven]] model was developed around 1885.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} However, many details have been improved, especially since the advent of [[modern materials]] and [[computer-aided design]]. These have allowed for a proliferation of specialized designs for many types of cycling.

The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that eventually played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including [[ball bearing]]s, [[tire|pneumatic tires]], [[chain-driven sprocket]]s and [[wire wheels|tension-spoked wheels]].&lt;ref&gt;Heitmann JA. ''The Automobile and American Life''. McFarland, 2009, {{ISBN|0-7864-4013-9}}, pp. 11ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bike and cycle are used interchangeably to refer mostly to two types of two-wheelers the terms still vary across the world. In India for example a cycle refers only to a two-wheeler using pedal power whereas the term bike is used to describe a two-wheeler using [[internal combustion engine]] or [[electric motors]] as a source of motive power instead of motorcycle/motorbike.

==Etymology==
The word ''bicycle'' first appeared in English print in ''[[The Daily News (UK)|The Daily News]]'' in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{OED|bicycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; The design of the bicycle was an advance on the [[velocipede]], although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.&lt;ref name=OED/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bicycle |title=bicycle (n.) |dictionary=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words for bicycle include "bike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|bike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pushbike",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pushbike}}&lt;/ref&gt; "pedal cycle",&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|pedal cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "cycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Unicode]], the [[code point]] for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The [[Numeric character reference|entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#x1F6B2;&lt;/code&gt; in [[HTML]] produces &#128690;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F680.pdf |title=Transport and Map Symbols |publisher=unicode.org |access-date=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michauxjun.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Michaux's son on a velocipede 1868]]
The first mechanically-propelled, two-wheeled vehicle may have been built by [[Kirkpatrick MacMillan]], a Scottish blacksmith, in 1839, although the claim is often disputed.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=66–67}} He is also associated with the first recorded instance of a cycling traffic offense, when a Glasgow newspaper in 1842 reported an accident in which an anonymous "gentleman from Dumfries-shire... bestride a velocipede... of ingenious design" knocked over a little girl in Glasgow and was fined five [[shilling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13040607 |title=Is dangerous cycling a problem? |work=BBC News |date=13 April 2011 |access-date=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s, Frenchmen [[Pierre Michaux]] and [[Pierre Lallement]] took bicycle design in a new direction by adding a mechanical [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] drive with pedals on an enlarged front wheel (the [[velocipede]]). This was the first in mass production. Another French inventor named Douglas Grasso had a failed prototype of Pierre Lallement's bicycle several years earlier. Several inventions followed using rear-wheel drive, the best known being the rod-driven velocipede by Scotsman [[Thomas McCall (inventor)|Thomas McCall]] in 1869. In that same year, bicycle wheels with wire spokes were patented by [[Eugène Meyer (inventor)|Eugène Meyer]] of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;''Bulletin des lois de la République française'' (1873) 12th series, vol. 6, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8S0UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA648#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 648, patent no. 86,705: "Perfectionnements dans les roues de vélocipèdes"] (Improvements in the wheels of bicycles), issued: 4 August 1869.&lt;/ref&gt; The French ''vélocipède'', made of iron and wood, developed into the "[[penny-farthing]]" (historically known as an "ordinary bicycle", a [[retronym]], since there was then no other kind).{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=50}} It featured a tubular steel frame on which were mounted wire-spoked wheels with solid rubber tires. These bicycles were difficult to ride due to their high seat and poor [[weight distribution]]. In 1868 Rowley Turner, a sales agent of the Coventry Sewing Machine Company (which soon became the [[Hillman#History|Coventry Machinists Company]]), brought a Michaux cycle to [[Coventry]], England. His uncle, Josiah Turner, and business partner [[James Starley]], used this as a basis for the 'Coventry Model' in what became Britain's first cycle factory.&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, David. ''A History of Coventry'' (Chichester: Phillimore, 2003), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1886 Starley 'Rover' Safety Cycle British Motor Museum 09-2016 (29928044262).jpg|thumb|1886 [[Rover Company#Before cars|Rover]] [[safety bicycle]] at the [[British Motor Museum]]. The first modern bicycle, it featured a rear-wheel-drive, [[chain-drive]]n cycle with two similar-sized wheels. Dunlop's [[Bicycle tire|pneumatic tire]] was added to the bicycle in 1888.]]

The ''dwarf ordinary'' addressed some of these faults by reducing the front wheel [[diameter]] and setting the [[bicycle seat|seat]] further back. This, in turn, required gearing—effected in a variety of ways—to efficiently use pedal power. Having to both pedal and steer via the front wheel remained a problem. Englishman [[John Kemp Starley|J.K. Starley]] (nephew of James Starley), J.H. Lawson, and Shergold solved this problem by introducing the [[chain drive]] (originated by the unsuccessful "bicyclette" of Englishman Henry Lawson),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=47}} connecting the frame-mounted cranks to the rear wheel. These models were known as [[safety bicycle]]s, dwarf safeties, or upright bicycles for their lower seat height and better weight distribution, although without pneumatic tires the ride of the smaller-wheeled bicycle would be much rougher than that of the larger-wheeled variety. Starley's 1885 [[Rover Company|Rover]], manufactured in Coventry&lt;ref&gt;McGrory, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; is usually described as the first recognizably modern bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cycle market: Moving into the fast lane|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/cycle-market-moving-into-the-fast-lane-1702191.html|agency=The Independent|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the ''seat tube'' was added, creating the modern bike's double-triangle ''diamond frame''.

[[File:John Boyd Dunlop (c1915).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Boyd Dunlop]] on a bicycle c. 1915]]

Further innovations increased comfort and ushered in a second [[bicycle craze]], the 1890s ''Golden Age of Bicycles''. In 1888, Scotsman [[John Boyd Dunlop]] introduced the first practical pneumatic tire, which soon became universal. [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tyres in 1889, winning the tyre's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.&lt;ref name="Gold Hume"&gt;[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling – William Hume, 1938.

[[Derailleur gears|Dérailleur gears]] and hand-operated [[Bowden cable]]-pull brakes were also developed during these years, but were only slowly adopted by casual riders.

The [[Svea Velocipede]] with vertical pedal arrangement and [[locking hubs]] was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers [[Fredrik Ljungström]] and [[Birger Ljungström]]. It attracted attention at the [[World Fair]] and was produced in a few thousand units.

[[File:Old CTC sign.jpg|thumb|[[Cycling UK|Cyclists' Touring Club]] sign on display at the [[National Museum of Scotland]]]]

In the 1870s many [[cycling club]]s flourished. They were popular in a time when there were not cars on the market and the principal mode of transportation was [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, such the [[horse and buggy]] or the [[horsecar]]. Among the earliest clubs was [[Cycling UK|The Bicycle Touring Club]], which has operated since 1878. By the turn of the century, cycling clubs flourished on both sides of the Atlantic, and touring and racing became widely popular. The [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]] was founded in Nottingham, England in 1888. It became the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, making over two million bikes per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=On Your Bike...|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/eastmidlands/series2/raleigh_bikes_cycling.shtml|agency=BBC|date=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles and horse buggies were the two mainstays of private transportation just prior to the automobile, and the grading of smooth roads in the late 19th century was stimulated by the widespread advertising, production, and use of these devices.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} More than 1&amp;nbsp;billion bicycles have been manufactured worldwide as of the early 21st century.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Economist2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=worldmeters/&gt; Bicycles are the most common vehicle of any kind in the world, and the most numerous model of any kind of vehicle, whether human-powered or [[motor vehicle]], is the Chinese [[Flying Pigeon]], with numbers exceeding 500 million.&lt;ref name=Koeppel2007/&gt; The next most numerous vehicle, the [[Honda Super Cub]] motorcycle, has more than 60 million units made, while most produced car, the [[Toyota Corolla]], has reached 35 million and counting.&lt;ref name=Squatriglia2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMA2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxBusiness/&gt;

==Uses==
From the beginning and still today, bicycles have been and are employed for many uses. In a utilitarian way, bicycles are used for transportation, [[bicycle commuting]], and [[utility cycling]]. It can be used as a 'work horse', used by [[Bicycle mail|mail carriers]], [[paramedic]]s, [[Police bicycle|police]], [[Bicycle messenger|messengers]], and [[Freight bicycle|general delivery]] services. Military uses of bicycles include [[Military communications|communications]], [[reconnaissance]], troop movement, supply of provisions, and patrol. See also: [[bicycle infantry]].

The bicycle is also used for recreational purposes, such as [[bicycle touring]], [[mountain biking]], [[physical fitness]], and [[Play (activity)|play]]. [[Cycle sport|Bicycle competition]] includes [[Road bicycle racing|racing]], [[BMX racing]], [[Track cycling|track racing]], [[criterium]], [[bicycle rollers|roller racing]], [[cyclosportive|sportives]] and [[time trial]]s. Major multi-stage professional events are the [[Giro d'Italia]], the [[Tour de France]], the [[Vuelta a España]], the [[Tour de Pologne]], and the [[Volta a Portugal]].

Bikes can be used for entertainment and pleasure, such as in organised mass rides, [[artistic cycling]] and [[freestyle BMX]].

==Technical aspects==
[[File:Firefighter bicycle.jpg|thumb|Firefighter bicycle]]

The bicycle has undergone continual adaptation and improvement since its inception. These innovations have continued with the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design, allowing for a proliferation of specialized bicycle types, improved [[bicycle safety]], and riding comfort.

===Types===
{{Main|List of bicycle types}}
[[File:A man riding an electric bicycle.jpg|thumb|left|A man riding an [[electric bicycle]]]]

Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include [[utility bicycle]]s, [[mountain bicycle]]s, [[racing bicycle]]s, [[touring bicycle]]s, [[hybrid bicycle]]s, [[cruiser bicycle]]s, and [[BMX bike]]s. Less common are [[tandem bicycle|tandems]], [[Lowrider bicycle|low riders]], [[tall bike]]s, [[Fixed-gear bicycle|fixed gear]], [[folding bicycle|folding models]], [[amphibious bicycles]], [[freight bicycle]]s, [[recumbent bicycle|recumbents]] and [[electric bicycles]].

[[Unicycle]]s, [[tricycle]]s and [[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycles]] are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".

===Dynamics===
{{Main|Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics}}
[[File:Jersey Town Criterium 2011 81.jpg|thumb|upright|A cyclist leaning in a turn]]

A bicycle stays upright while moving forward by being steered so as to keep its [[center of mass]] over the wheels.&lt;ref name="NS2581"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Various|date=9 December 2006|title=Like falling off|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.400|url-status=dead|journal=New Scientist|issue=2581|page=93|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204070845/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19225812.400|archive-date=4 December 2008|access-date=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This steering is usually provided by the rider, but under certain conditions may be provided by the bicycle itself.&lt;ref name=MPRS&gt;{{cite journal

The combined center of mass of a bicycle and its rider must lean into a turn to successfully navigate it. This lean is induced by a method known as [[countersteering]], which can be performed by the rider turning the handlebars directly with the hands&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book

The bicycle is extraordinarily efficient in both biological and mechanical terms. The bicycle is the most efficient human-powered means of transportation in terms of energy a person must expend to travel a given distance.&lt;ref&gt;S.S. Wilson, "Bicycle Technology", ''[[Scientific American]]'', March 1973&lt;/ref&gt; From a mechanical viewpoint, up to 99% of the energy delivered by the rider into the pedals is transmitted to the wheels, although the use of gearing mechanisms may reduce this by 10–15%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pedal power probe shows bicycles waste little energy |url=http://www.jhu.edu/~gazette/1999/aug3099/30pedal.html |work=Johns Hopkins Gazette |date=30 August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitt"&gt;{{cite book

A human traveling on a bicycle at low to medium speeds of around {{Convert|16|–|24|km/h|abbr=on|0}} uses only the power required to walk. Air drag, which is proportional to the square of speed, requires dramatically higher power outputs as speeds increase. If the rider is sitting upright, the rider's body creates about 75% of the total drag of the bicycle/rider combination. Drag can be reduced by seating the rider in a more [[aerodynamic]]ally streamlined position. Drag can also be reduced by covering the bicycle with an aerodynamic [[Bicycle fairing|fairing]]. The fastest recorded unpaced speed on a flat surface is {{Convert|144.18|km/h|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="upi"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, the [[carbon dioxide]] generated in the production and transportation of the food required by the bicyclist, per mile traveled, is less than 1/10 that generated by energy efficient motorcars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenkifer.com/bikepages/advocacy/bike_co2.htm |title=How Much Do Bicycles Pollute?

==Parts==
===Frame===
{{Main|Bicycle frame}}
[[File:Bicycle diagram-en.svg|thumb|Diagram of a bicycle]]

The great majority of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=200–50}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|p=280}} These upright bicycles almost always feature the ''diamond frame'', a [[truss]] consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down tube, and seat tube. The head tube contains the [[headset (bicycle part)|headset]], the set of bearings that allows the [[bicycle fork|fork]] to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head tube to the seat tube at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the [[bottom bracket]]. The rear triangle consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the [[bicycle chain|chain]], connecting the bottom bracket to the rear [[Fork end|dropout]], where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect the top of the seat tube (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.

[[File:Triumph Bicycle.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Triumph Cycle Co. Ltd.|Triumph]] with a [[step-through frame]]]]

Historically, women's bicycle frames had a top tube that connected in the middle of the seat tube instead of the top, resulting in a lower [[Frame geometry|standover height]] at the expense of compromised structural integrity, since this places a strong bending load in the seat tube, and bicycle frame members are typically weak in bending. This design, referred to as a ''[[step-through frame]]'' or as an ''open frame'', allows the rider to mount and dismount in a dignified way while wearing a skirt or dress. While some women's bicycles continue to use this frame style, there is also a variation, the ''[[mixte]]'', which splits the top tube laterally into two thinner top tubes that bypass the seat tube on each side and connect to the rear fork ends. The ease of stepping through is also appreciated by those with limited flexibility or other joint problems. Because of its persistent image as a "women's" bicycle, step-through frames are not common for larger frames.

Step-throughs were popular partly for practical reasons and partly for social mores of the day. For most of the history of bicycles' popularity women have worn long skirts, and the lower frame accommodated these better than the top-tube. Furthermore, it was considered "unladylike" for women to open their legs to mount and dismount—in more conservative times women who rode bicycles at all were vilified as immoral or immodest. These practices were akin to the older practice of riding horse [[sidesaddle]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Another style is the [[recumbent bicycle]]. These are inherently more aerodynamic than upright versions, as the rider may lean back onto a support and operate pedals that are on about the same level as the seat. The world's fastest bicycle is a recumbent bicycle but this type was banned from competition in 1934 by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1 April 1934|title=History Loudly Tells Why The Recumbent Bike Is Popular Today|url=http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802090926/http://www.recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com/history.html|archive-date=2 August 2003|access-date=24 October 2011|publisher=Recumbent-bikes-truth-for-you.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trek Y Foil.jpg|thumb|A carbon fiber [[Trek Bicycle Corporation|Trek]] Y-Foil from the late 1990s]]

Historically, materials used in bicycles have followed a similar pattern as in aircraft, the goal being high strength and low weight. Since the late 1930s alloy steels have been used for frame and fork tubes in higher quality machines. By the 1980s aluminum welding techniques had improved to the point that aluminum tube could safely be used in place of steel. Since then aluminum alloy frames and other components have become popular due to their light weight, and most mid-range bikes are now principally aluminum alloy of some kind.{{Where?|date=August 2012}} More expensive bikes use [[carbon fibre]] due to its significantly lighter weight and profiling ability, allowing designers to make a bike both stiff and compliant by manipulating the lay-up. Virtually all professional racing bicycles now use carbon fibre frames, as they have the best strength to weight ratio. A typical modern carbon fiber frame can weighs less than {{convert|1|kg|lb}}.

Other exotic frame materials include [[titanium]] and advanced alloys. [[Bamboo]], a natural [[composite material]] with high strength-to-weight ratio and [[stiffness]]&lt;ref name="Lakkad"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mechanical properties of bamboo, a natural composite |last1=Lakkad |last2=Patel |journal=Fibre Science and Technology |volume=14 |issue=4 |date=June 1981 |pages=319–22 |doi=10.1016/0015-0568(81)90023-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been used for bicycles since 1894.&lt;ref name=lukenbill&gt;{{cite web

===Drivetrain and gearing===
{{Main|Bicycle drivetrain systems}}
[[File:Dsb-1.jpg|thumb|text-top|A [[Shaft-driven bicycle|bicycle with shaft drive]] instead of a chain]]
[[File:Shimano xt rear derailleur.jpg|upright|thumb|A set of rear sprockets (also known as a cassette) and a derailleur]]
[[File:Hub gear.jpg|upright|thumb|Hub gear]]

The ''drivetrain'' begins with pedals which rotate the [[Crank set|cranks]], which are held in axis by the bottom bracket. Most bicycles use a chain to transmit power to the rear wheel. A very small number of bicycles use a shaft drive to transmit power, or special belts. Hydraulic bicycle transmissions have been built, but they are currently inefficient and complex.

Since cyclists' legs are most efficient over a narrow range of pedaling speeds, or [[Cadence (cycling)|cadence]], a variable [[gear ratio]] helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use [[hub gear]]s with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the [[chainring]] and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes have two or three chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, with the number of theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.

An alternative to chaindrive is to use a synchronous belt. These are toothed and work much the same as a chain—popular with commuters and long distance cyclists they require little maintenance. They can't be shifted across a cassette of sprockets, and are used either as single speed or with a hub gear.

[[Bicycle gearing|Different gears and ranges of gears]] are appropriate for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.

With a ''chain drive'' transmission, a ''chainring'' attached to a crank drives the chain, which in turn rotates the rear wheel via the rear sprocket(s) ([[cassette (bicycle part)|cassette]] or [[Cogset#Freewheels|freewheel]]). There are four gearing options: two-speed hub gear integrated with chain ring, up to 3 chain rings, up to 11 sprockets, hub gear built into rear wheel (3-speed to 14-speed). The most common options are either a rear hub or multiple chain rings combined with multiple sprockets (other combinations of options are possible but less common).

===Steering===
[[File:Anatomic bicycle grips made of leather.jpg|thumb|left|Bicycle grips made of leather. Anatomic shape distributes weight over [[hand|palm area]] to prevent Cyclist's palsy ([[Ulnar tunnel syndrome|Ulnar syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 12860549|year = 2003|last1 = Patterson|first1 = J.M.|title = Ulnar and median nerve palsy in long-distance cyclists.

The [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebars]] connect to the [[Stem (bike)|stem]] that connects to the fork that connects to the front wheel, and the whole assembly connects to the bike and rotates about the steering axis via the [[Headset (bicycle part)|headset]] bearings. Three styles of handlebar are common. ''Upright handlebars'', the norm in Europe and elsewhere until the 1970s, curve gently back toward the rider, offering a natural grip and comfortable upright position. ''Drop handlebars'' "drop" as they curve forward and down, offering the cyclist best braking power from a more aerodynamic "crouched" position, as well as more upright positions in which the hands grip the brake lever mounts, the forward curves, or the upper flat sections for increasingly upright postures. Mountain bikes generally feature a 'straight handlebar' or 'riser bar' with varying degrees of sweep backwards and centimeters rise upwards, as well as wider widths which can provide better handling due to increased leverage against the wheel.

===Seating===
[[File:San marco selle1.jpg|thumb|left|A Selle San Marco saddle designed for women]]
[[Bicycle saddle|Saddles]] also vary with rider preference, from the cushioned ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow more room for leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist for male and female cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and seat springs provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.

A recumbent bicycle has a reclined [[Bicycle seat|chair-like seat]] that some riders find more comfortable than a saddle, especially riders who suffer from certain types of seat, back, neck, shoulder, or wrist pain. Recumbent bicycles may have either under-seat or over-seat [[Recumbent bicycle#Steering|steering]].

===Brakes===
{{Main|Bicycle brake}}
[[File:Brake.agr-edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Linear-pull brake, also known by the [[Shimano]] trademark: V-Brake, on rear wheel of a [[mountain bike]]]]
Bicycle brakes may be rim brakes, in which friction pads are compressed against the wheel rims; hub brakes, where the mechanism is contained within the wheel hub, or disc brakes, where pads act on a rotor attached to the hub. Most road bicycles use rim brakes, but some use disk brakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2013/10/disc-brakes-and-road-bikes-what-does-the-future-hold/ |title=Disc Brakes and Road Bikes: What does the Future Hold? |publisher=cyclingtips.com.au |date=1 October 2013 |access-date=24 February 2014 |author=Wade Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disc brakes]] are more common for mountain bikes, tandems and recumbent bicycles than on other types of bicycles, due to their increased power, coupled with an increased weight and complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sheldonbrown.com/disc-brakes.html |title=Disc Brakes |publisher=sheldonbrown.com |author=John Allan |access-date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|left|A front disc brake, mounted to the [[Bicycle fork|fork]] and hub]]
With hand-operated brakes, force is applied to brake levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or [[hydraulic]] lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal ''coaster brakes'' which were popular in North America until the 1960s.

[[Track bicycle]]s do not have brakes, because all riders ride in the same direction around a track which does not necessitate sharp deceleration. Track riders are still able to slow down because all track bicycles are fixed-gear, meaning that there is no freewheel. Without a freewheel, coasting is impossible, so when the rear wheel is moving, the cranks are moving. To slow down, the rider applies resistance to the pedals, acting as a braking system which can be as effective as a conventional rear wheel brake, but not as effective as a front wheel brake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Suspension===
{{Main|Bicycle suspension}}

Bicycle suspension refers to the system or systems used to ''suspend'' the rider and all or part of the bicycle. This serves two purposes: to keep the wheels in continuous contact with the ground, improving control, and to isolate the rider and luggage from jarring due to rough surfaces, improving comfort.

Bicycle suspensions are used primarily on mountain bicycles, but are also common on hybrid bicycles, as they can help deal with problematic vibration from poor surfaces. Suspension is especially important on recumbent bicycles, since while an upright bicycle rider can stand on the pedals to achieve some of the benefits of suspension, a recumbent rider cannot.

Basic mountain bicycles and hybrids usually have front suspension only, whilst more sophisticated ones also have rear suspension. Road bicycles tend to have no suspension.

===Wheels and tires===
{{Main|Bicycle wheel|Bicycle tire}}

The wheel axle fits into fork ends in the frame and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, especially in the context of ready-built "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.

Tires vary enormously depending on their intended purpose. [[Road bicycles]] use tires 18 to 25 millimeters wide, most often completely smooth, or [[slick tire|slick]], and inflated to high pressure to roll fast on smooth surfaces. Off-road tires are usually between {{Convert|38|and|64|mm|abbr=on}} wide, and have treads for gripping in muddy conditions or metal studs for ice.

===Accessories===
[[File:Loaded touring bicycle.JPG|thumb|Touring bicycle equipped with front and rear [[Luggage carrier|racks]], fenders (called mud-guards), water bottles in [[Bottle cage|cages]], four [[pannier]]s and a handlebar bag]]

Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. [[Fender (vehicle)|fenders]] with spoilers (mudflaps)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bikeinn.com/bike/sks-spoiler-pro-50-60-mm/137484810/p&lt;/ref&gt; protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas. In Germany, fenders are called ([[Mudguard]]s).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sks-germany.com/en/productcategories/mudguards/ Mudguards (fenders)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chainguard]]s protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing clothing from being caught between the chain and [[crankset]] teeth. [[Kick stand]]s keep bicycles upright when parked, and [[bike lock]]s deter theft. Front-mounted [[bicycle basket|baskets]], front or rear [[luggage carrier]]s or racks, and [[pannier]]s mounted above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or rest.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Parents sometimes add rear-mounted [[Baby transport|child seats]], an auxiliary saddle fitted to the crossbar, or both to transport children. Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a [[bicycle trailer|trailer]] for carrying cargo, a child, or both.

[[Clipless#Clipless pedals|Toe-clips]] and toestraps and [[Bicycle pedal#Clipless pedals|clipless pedals]] help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include [[cyclocomputer]]s for measuring speed, distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include [[bicycle lighting|lights]], reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers, bags, water bottles and [[Bottle cage|cages]], and [[Bicycle bell|bell]].&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html#safety |title=Safety Accessories |access-date=13 September 2006 |last=Bluejay |first=Michael |work=Bicycle Accessories |publisher=BicycleUniverse.info| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061008024853/http://bicycleuniverse.info/eqp/accessories.html| archive-date= 8 October 2006 | url-status= live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators, dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high visibility clothing.

Children's bicycles may be outfitted with cosmetic enhancements such as [[Vehicle_horn#Bicycle|bike horns]], streamers, and [[Spokey Dokes|spoke beads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kicinski-Mccoy |first1=James |title=The Coolest Bike Accessories For Kids |url=https://www.mothermag.com/bike-accessories-for-kids/ |website=MOTHER |access-date=30 April 2020 |date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Training wheels]] are sometimes used when learning to ride.

[[Bicycle helmet]]s can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory&lt;ref name="bicycleuniverse" /&gt; or as an item of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Essentials of Bike Clothing|url=http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826085232/http://bicycling.about.com/library/weekly/aa041098.htm|archive-date=26 August 2006|access-date=13 September 2006|work=About Bicycling|publisher=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicycle trainer|Bike trainers]] are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary.

===Standards===
A number of formal and industry standards exist for bicycle components to help make spare parts exchangeable and to maintain a minimum product safety.

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) has a special technical committee for cycles, TC149, that has the scope of "Standardization in the field of cycles, their components and accessories with particular reference to terminology, testing methods and requirements for performance and safety, and interchangeability".

The [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN) also has a specific Technical Committee, TC333, that defines European standards for cycles. Their mandate states that EN cycle standards shall harmonize with [[List of ISO standards|ISO standards]]. Some CEN cycle standards were developed before ISO published their standards, leading to strong European influences in this area. European cycle standards tend to describe minimum safety requirements, while ISO standards have historically harmonized parts geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The TC149 ISO bicycle committee, including the TC149/SC1 ("Cycles and major sub-assemblies") subcommittee, has published the following standards:{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Maintenance and repair==
Like all devices with mechanical moving parts, bicycles do require a certain amount of regular maintenance and replacement of worn parts. A bicycle is relatively simple compared with a car, so some cyclists choose to do at least part of the maintenance themselves. Some components are easy to handle using relatively simple tools, while other components may require specialist manufacturer-dependent tools.

Many bicycle components are available at several different price/quality points; manufacturers generally try to keep all components on any particular bike at about the same quality level, though at the very cheap end of the market there may be some skimping on less obvious components (e.g. bottom bracket).
* There exist several hundred assisted-service Community Bicycle Organizations worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Bicycle Organizations|url=http://www.bikecollectives.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community_Bicycle_Organizations|publisher=Bike Collective Network wiki|access-date=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a Community Bicycle Organization, [[wikt:layperson#Noun|laypeople]] bring in bicycles needing repair or maintenance; volunteers teach them how to do the required steps.
* Full service is available from [[bicycle mechanic]]s at a [[local bike shop]].
* In areas where it is available, some cyclists purchase roadside assistance from companies such as the [[Better World Club]] or the [[American Automobile Association]].
===Maintenance===
The most basic maintenance item is keeping the tires correctly inflated; this can make a noticeable difference as to how the bike feels to ride. Bicycle tires usually have a marking on the side wall indicating the pressure appropriate for that tire. Note that bicycles use much higher pressures than cars: car tires are normally in the range 30 to 40 pounds per square inch while bicycle tires are normally in the range 60 to 100 pounds per square inch.

Another basic maintenance item is regular lubrication of the chain and pivot points for derailleurs and brakes. Most of the bearings on a modern bike are sealed and grease-filled and require little or no attention; such bearings will usually last for 10,000 miles or more.

The chain and the brake blocks are the components which wear out most quickly, so these need to be checked from time to time (typically every 500 miles or so). Most local bike shops will do such checks for free. Note that when a chain becomes badly worn it will also wear out the rear cogs/cassette and eventually the chain ring(s), so replacing a chain when only moderately worn will prolong the life of other components.

Over the longer term, tires do wear out (2000 to 5000 miles); a rash of punctures is often the most visible sign of a worn tire.

===Repair===
Very few bicycle components can actually be repaired; replacement of the failing component is the normal practice.

The most common roadside problem is a puncture. After removing the offending nail/tack/thorn/glass shard/etc. there are two approaches: either mend the puncture by the roadside, or replace the inner tube and then mend the puncture in the comfort of home. Some brands of tires are much more puncture resistant than others, often incorporating one or more layers of [[Kevlar]]; the downside of such tires is that they may be heavier and/or more difficult to fit and remove.

There are specialized bicycle tools for use both in the shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a [[Bicycle pump|hand pump]] or [[Bicycle pump#CO2 Inflators|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pump]], [[tire lever]]s, spare [[Inner tube|tubes]], self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing "cones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are also cycling specific [[multi-tool]]s that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.

==Social and historical aspects==
The bicycle has had a considerable effect on human society, in both the cultural and industrial realms.

===In daily life===
Around the turn of the 20th century, bicycles reduced crowding in inner-city tenements by allowing workers to commute from more spacious dwellings in the suburbs. They also reduced dependence on horses. Bicycles allowed people to travel for leisure into the country, since bicycles were three times as energy efficient as walking and three to four times as fast.

In built up cities around the world, [[urban planning]] uses [[cycling infrastructure]] like bikeways to reduce [[traffic congestion]] and air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3005092 | pmid=21174189 | doi=10.1007/s11524-010-9509-6 | volume=87 | issue=6 | title=Built environment influences on healthy transportation choices: bicycling versus driving | year=2010 | journal=J Urban Health | pages=969–93 | last1 = Winters | first1 = M | last2 = Brauer | first2 = M | last3 = Setton | first3 = EM | last4 = Teschke | first4 = K}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of cities around the world have implemented schemes known as [[bicycle sharing system]]s or community bicycle programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Guzman |first2=Stacey |last3=Zhang |first3=Hua |title=Bikesharing in Europe, the Americas, and Asia |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2143 |year=2010 |pages=159–67 |doi=10.3141/2143-20|s2cid=40770008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaheen |first=Stacey |author2=Stacey Guzman |title=Worldwide Bikesharing |journal=Access Magazine |year=2011 |url=http://uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326063609/http://www.uctc.net/access/39/access39_bikesharing.shtml |archive-date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was the White Bicycle plan in [[Amsterdam]] in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in [[La Rochelle]] and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shaheen |first1=Susan |last2=Zhang |first2=Hua |last3=Martin |first3=Elliot |last4=Guzman |first4=Stacey |title=China's Hangzhou Public Bicycle |journal=Transportation Research Record |volume=2247 |year=2011 |pages=33–41 |doi=10.3141/2247-05|s2cid=111120290 |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt62d8f2g3/qt62d8f2g3.pdf?t=psbd9f }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/|title=Tax free bikes for work through the Government's Green Transport Initiative |publisher=Cyclescheme}}{{psc|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Netherlands]] all train stations offer free bicycle parking, or a more secure parking place for a small fee, with the larger stations also offering bicycle repair shops. Cycling is so popular that the parking capacity may be exceeded, while in some places such as Delft the capacity is usually exceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Trondheim]] in Norway, the [[Trampe bicycle lift]] has been developed to encourage cyclists by giving assistance on a steep hill. Buses in many cities have [[bicycle carrier]]s mounted on the front.

There are towns in some countries where [[bicycle culture]] has been an integral part of the landscape for generations, even without much official support. That is the case of [[Ílhavo Municipality|Ílhavo]], in Portugal.

In cities where bicycles are not integrated into the public transportation system, commuters often use bicycles as elements of a [[mixed-mode commuting|mixed-mode commute]], where the bike is used to travel to and from train stations or other forms of rapid transit. Some students who commute several miles drive a car from home to a campus parking lot, then ride a bicycle to class. [[Folding bicycle]]s are useful in these scenarios, as they are less cumbersome when carried aboard. Los Angeles removed a small amount of seating on some trains to make more room for bicycles and wheel chairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some US companies, notably in the [[High tech#Technology sectors|tech sector]], are developing both innovative cycle designs and cycle-friendliness in the workplace. [[Foursquare (company)|Foursquare]], whose CEO [[Dennis Crowley]] "pedaled to pitch meetings ... [when he] was raising money from [[venture capitalists]]" on a two-wheeler, chose a new location for its New York headquarters "based on where biking would be easy". Parking in the office was also integral to HQ planning. Mitchell Moss, who runs the [[Rudin Center for Transportation Policy &amp; Management]] at [[New York University]], said in 2012: "Biking has become the mode of choice for the educated high tech worker".&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Andrea, [https://web.archive.org/web/20120223233448/http://www.marketplace.org/topics/tech/transportation-nation/techies-cutting-edge-bike-commuting "Techies on the cutting edge... of bike commuting"], ''[[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]]'', 22 February 2012.

Bicycles offer an important mode of transport in many developing countries. Until recently, bicycles have been a staple of everyday life throughout Asian countries. They are the most frequently used method of transport for commuting to work, school, shopping, and life in general. In Europe, bicycles are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/10/24/240493422/in-most-every-european-country-bikes-are-outselling-cars|title=In Almost Every European Country, Bikes Are Outselling New Cars|date=24 October 2013|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also offer a degree of exercise to keep individuals healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/bicyclevehiclefo0000lowe |first=Marcia D. |last=Lowe |year=1989 |title=The Bicycle: Vehicle for a Small Planet |publisher=Worldwatch Institute |isbn=978-0-916468-91-0 |url-access=registration }}{{page needed|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bicycles are also celebrated in the visual arts. An example of this is the [[Bicycle Film Festival]], a film festival hosted all around the world.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural [[Poverty reduction|poverty alleviation]], has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be an important poverty-eradication tool in poor nations.

===Female emancipation===

The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to [[Emancipation of women|their emancipation]] in Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolize the [[New Woman]] of the late 19th century, especially in Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|access-date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bike boom#1890s|bicycle craze in the 1890s]] also led to a movement for so-called [[Victorian dress reform|rational dress]], which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other restrictive garments, substituting the then-shocking [[bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]].{{sfn|Herlihy|2004|pp=266–71}}

The bicycle was recognized by 19th-century feminists and [[suffragist]]s as a "freedom machine" for women. American [[Susan B. Anthony]] said in a ''[[New York World]]'' interview on 2 February 1896:
"I think it has done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world. I rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel. It gives her a feeling of self-reliance and independence the moment she takes her seat; and away she goes, the picture of untrammelled womanhood."&lt;ref name=HustedHarper1898/&gt;{{rp|859}} In 1895 [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]], the tightly laced president of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], wrote ''A Wheel Within a Wheel: How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle, with Some Reflections by the Way'', a 75-page illustrated memoir praising "Gladys", her bicycle, for its "gladdening effect" on her health and political optimism.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt; Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action.&lt;ref name=Willard1895/&gt;

In 1985, Georgena Terry started the first women-specific bicycle company. Her designs featured frame geometry and wheel sizes chosen to better fit women, with shorter top tubes and more suitable reach.[https://velojoy.com/2012/07/04/6-questions-for-womens-bicycling-pioneer-georgena-terry/]

===Economic implications===
[[File:Columbia Bicycles 1886 Advertisement.svg|left|thumb|upright|[[Columbia Bicycles]] advertisement from 1886]]
[[Bicycle industry|Bicycle manufacturing]] proved to be a training ground for other industries and led to the development of advanced metalworking techniques, both for the frames themselves and for special components such as [[ball bearing]]s, [[washer (mechanical)|washers]], and sprockets. These techniques later enabled skilled metalworkers and mechanics to develop the components used in early automobiles and aircraft.

[[Wright brothers|Wilbur and Orville Wright]], a pair of businessmen, ran the [[Wright Cycle Company]] which designed, manufactured and sold their bicycles during the [[bike boom]] of the 1890s.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11373/ |title = Wilbur Wright Working in the Bicycle Shop |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1897 |access-date = 22 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also served to teach the industrial models later adopted, including mechanization and [[mass production]] (later copied and adopted by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors]]),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} vertical integration{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=106}} (also later copied and adopted by Ford), aggressive advertising{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=142–47}} (as much as 10% of all advertising in U.S. periodicals in 1898 was by bicycle makers),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=145}} lobbying for better roads (which had the side benefit of acting as advertising, and of improving sales by providing more places to ride),{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} all first practiced by Pope.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}} In addition, bicycle makers adopted the annual model change{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon. ''The Most Benevolent Machine: A Historical Assessment of Cycles in Canada'' (Ottawa: National Museum of Science and Technology, 1998), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; (later derided as [[planned obsolescence]], and usually credited to General Motors), which proved very successful.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early bicycles were an example of [[conspicuous consumption]], being adopted by the fashionable elites.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=12}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=14}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=147–48}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=187–88}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=208}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=243–45}} In addition, by serving as a platform for accessories, which could ultimately cost more than the bicycle itself, it paved the way for the likes of the [[Barbie doll]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=23}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=121}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}

Bicycles helped create, or enhance, new kinds of businesses, such as bicycle messengers,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=212}} traveling seamstresses,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=214}} riding academies,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} and racing rinks.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=131}} Their board tracks were later adapted to early [[motorcycle racing|motorcycle]] and [[automobile racing]]. There were a variety of new inventions, such as [[spoke]] tighteners,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} and specialized lights,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=123}}{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=125}} socks and shoes,{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=125–26}} and even cameras, such as the [[Eastman Kodak|Eastman Company]]'s Poco.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=238}} Probably the best known and most widely used of these inventions, adopted well beyond cycling, is Charles Bennett's Bike Web, which came to be called the [[jock strap]].{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=128}}

[[File:Person mit fahrrad feb07.jpg|thumb|upright|A man uses a bicycle to carry goods in [[Ouagadougou]], [[Burkina Faso]]]]
They also presaged a move away from public transit{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|pp=214–15}} that would explode with the introduction of the automobile.

J. K. Starley's company became the Rover Cycle Company Ltd. in the late 1890s, and then simply the [[Rover Company]] when it started making cars. [[Morris Motors]] Limited (in [[Oxford]]) and [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] also began in the bicycle business, as did the [[Wright brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alistair Craig, whose company eventually emerged to become the engine manufacturers [[Ailsa Craig Engines|Ailsa Craig]], also started from manufacturing bicycles, in Glasgow in March 1885.

In general, U.S. and European cycle manufacturers used to assemble cycles from their own frames and components made by other companies, although very large companies (such as Raleigh) used to make almost every part of a bicycle (including bottom brackets, axles, etc.) In recent years, those bicycle makers have greatly changed their methods of production. Now, almost none of them produce their own frames.

Many newer or smaller companies only design and market their products; the actual production is done by Asian companies. For example, some 60% of the world's bicycles are now being made in China. Despite this shift in production, as nations such as China and India become more wealthy, their own use of bicycles has declined due to the increasing affordability of cars and motorcycles.&lt;ref&gt;

===Environmental impact===
One of the profound economic implications of bicycle use is that it liberates the user from oil consumption. (Ballantine, 1972) The bicycle is an inexpensive, fast, healthy and environmentally friendly mode of transport. [[Ivan Illich]] stated that bicycle use extended the usable physical environment for people, while alternatives such as cars and motorways degraded and confined people's environment and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Illich, I. (1974). ''Energy and equity''. New York, Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, two billion bicycles are in use around the world. Children, students, professionals, laborers, civil servants and seniors are pedaling around their communities. They all experience the freedom and the natural opportunity for exercise that the bicycle easily provides. Bicycle also has lowest carbon intensity of travel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/global-cyclists-say-no-carbon-opt-cdm "Global cyclists say NO to carbon – opt for CDM"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004035739/http://blogs.worldbank.org/publicsphere/global-cyclists-say-no-carbon-opt-cdm |date=4 October 2017 }}, The World Bank, 27 October 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal requirements===
{{Main|Bicycle law}}
Early in its development, as with [[automobile]]s, there were restrictions on the operation of bicycles. Along with advertising, and to gain free publicity, [[Albert A. Pope]] litigated on behalf of cyclists.{{sfn|Norcliffe|2001|p=108}}

The 1968 [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] of the United Nations considers a bicycle to be a vehicle, and a person controlling a bicycle (whether actually riding or not) is considered an operator. The traffic codes of many countries reflect these definitions and demand that a bicycle satisfy certain legal requirements before it can be used on public roads. In many [[jurisdiction]]s, it is an offense to use a bicycle that is not in a roadworthy condition.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In most jurisdictions, bicycles must have functioning front and rear lights when ridden after dark. As some generator or [[dynamo]]-driven lamps operate only while moving, rear [[retroreflector|reflectors]] are frequently also mandatory. Since a moving bicycle makes little noise, some countries insist that bicycles have a warning bell for use when approaching pedestrians, equestrians, and other cyclists, though sometimes a [[car horn]] can be used when a 12 volt battery is available.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Some countries require child and/or adult cyclists to wear helmets, as this may protect riders from head trauma. Countries which require adult cyclists to wear helmets include Spain, [[Bicycle helmets in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and Australia. Mandatory helmet wearing is one of the most controversial topics in the cycling world, with proponents arguing that it reduces head injuries and thus is an acceptable requirement, while opponents argue that by making cycling seem more dangerous and cumbersome, it reduces cyclist numbers on the streets, creating an overall negative health effect (fewer people cycling for their own health, and the remaining cyclists being more exposed through a reversed [[safety in numbers]] effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=5 April 2017|title=Want Safer Streets for Cyclists?

===Theft===

[[File:2008-09-06 Solitary bicycle wheel in a bike rack.jpg|thumb|upright|A bicycle wheel remains chained in a bike rack after the rest of the bicycle has been stolen at east campus of [[Duke University]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].]]

'''Cologne''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|k|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|n}} {{respell|kə|LOHN}}; {{lang-de|Köln}} {{IPA-de|kœln||Koeln.ogg}}; {{lang-ksh|Kölle}} {{IPA-ksh|ˈkœlə||Koelle.ogg}}; {{lang-lat|Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium}}, usually shortened to {{lang|la|Colonia Agrippina}}) is the largest city of [[Germany|Germany's]] most populous [[States of Germany|federal state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and the [[List of cities in Germany by population|fourth-most populous city]] in Germany. With slightly over a million inhabitants (1.09 million) within its [[city proper|city boundaries]], Cologne is the largest city on the [[Rhine]] and also the most populous city both of the [[Rhine-Ruhr|Rhine-Ruhr Metropolitan Region]], which is [[Metropolitan regions in Germany#Metropolitan regions|Germany's largest]] and one of [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe#Metropolitan areas|Europe's major metropolitan areas]], and of the [[Rhineland]]. Centered on the left bank of the Rhine, Cologne is about {{convert|45|km}} southeast of North Rhine-Westphalia's capital of [[Düsseldorf]] and {{convert|25|km}} northwest of [[Bonn]]. It is the largest city in the [[Central Franconian]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] dialect areas.

The city's [[Cologne Cathedral]] (''Kölner Dom'') is the seat of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[List of bishops and archbishops of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]. There are many institutions of higher education in the city, most notably the [[University of Cologne]] (''Universität zu Köln''), one of Europe's oldest and largest universities,&lt;ref name="Cologneeconomy"&gt;{{cite web |title= Economy |url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/economy |publisher= KölnTourismus |access-date= 18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Technical University of Cologne]] (''Technische Hochschule Köln''), Germany's largest university of applied sciences, and the [[German Sport University Cologne]] (''Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln''), Germany's only sport university. [[Cologne Bonn Airport]] (''Flughafen Köln/Bonn'') is Germany's seventh-largest airport and lies in the southeast of the city. The main airport for the Rhine-Ruhr region is [[Düsseldorf Airport]].

Cologne was founded and established in [[Ubii]] territory in the 1st century AD as the [[Roman colony|Roman]] ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'', the first word of which is the origin of its name.&lt;ref name="Cologne History"&gt;{{cite web |title= From Ubii village to metropolis |url= http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis |publisher= City of Cologne |archive-date= 17 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417171004/http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/history/from_ubii_village_metropolis}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative Latin name of the settlement is ''Augusta Ubiorum'', after the Ubii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Benjamin E. |last= Smith |contribution= Augusta Ubiorum |title= The Century Cyclopedia of Names |location= New York |publisher= Century Co. |year= 1895 |volume= 1 |edition= 2nd |oclc= 237135281 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RXZFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA96 |page= 96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Cologne", the French version of the city's name, has become standard in English as well. Cologne functioned as the capital of the Roman province of ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and as the headquarters of the Roman military in the region until occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks|Franks]] in 462. During the [[Middle Ages]] the city flourished as being located on one of the most important major [[trade routes]] between east and western Europe. Cologne was one of the leading members of the [[Hanseatic League]] and one of the largest cities north of the [[Alps]] in medieval and Renaissance times. Prior to [[World War II]], the city had undergone several occupations by the French and also by the British (1918–1926). Cologne was one of the most heavily bombed cities in Germany during World War II, with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) dropping {{convert|34,711|long ton|tonne|abbr= off}} of [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|bombs on the city]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|title= bomber command – mines laid – flight august – 1945 – 1571 – Flight Archive|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190704161459/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201571.html|archive-date= 4 July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing reduced the population by 95%, mainly due to evacuation, and destroyed almost the entire city centre. With the intention of restoring as many historic landmarks as possible, the postwar rebuilding has resulted in a very mixed and unique cityscape.

Cologne is a major cultural centre for the [[Rhineland]]; it hosts more than 30 museums and hundreds of galleries. Exhibitions range from local ancient Roman archeological sites to contemporary graphics and sculpture. The [[Cologne Trade Fair]] hosts a number of [[trade show]]s such as [[Art Cologne]], [[imm Cologne]], [[Gamescom]], and the [[Photokina]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cologne|Timeline of Cologne}}

===Roman Cologne===
[[File:Wall painting with Dionysian scenes from a luxurious Roman villa excavated to the south of the cathedral, Romisch-Germanisches Museum, Cologne (8119154487).jpg|thumb|Fresco with [[Dionysian mysteries|Dionysian scenes]] from a Roman villa of Cologne, [[Germany]] (site of the ancient city [[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]), 3rd century AD, [[Romano-Germanic Museum]]]]
The first urban settlement on the grounds of modern-day Cologne was ''Oppidum Ubiorum'', founded in 38&amp;nbsp;BC by the [[Ubii]], a [[Germani cisrhenani|Cisrhenian]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]]. In 50&amp;nbsp;AD, the Romans founded ''[[Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium]]'' (Cologne) on the river [[Rhine]]&lt;ref name="Cologne History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Facts and figures"/&gt; and the city became the provincial capital of [[Germania Inferior]] in 85&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Facts and figures"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts and figures|url=https://www.cologne.de/facts-and-figures.html|publisher=City of Cologne|access-date=3 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considerable Roman remains can be found in present-day Cologne, especially near the wharf area, where a 1,900-year-old Roman boat was discovered in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18208 |title=C.Michael Hogan, ''Cologne Wharf'', The Megalithic Portal, editor Andy Burnham, 2007 |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |access-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 260 to 271, Cologne was the capital of the [[Gallic Empire]] under [[Postumus]], [[Marcus Aurelius Marius|Marius]], and [[Victorinus]]. In 310, under emperor [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]], a bridge was built over the Rhine at Cologne. Roman imperial governors resided in the city and it became one of the most important trade and production centres in the Roman Empire north of the Alps.&lt;ref name="Cologne History"/&gt; Cologne is shown on the [[4th century]] [[Peutinger Map]].

Maternus, who was elected as bishop in 313, was the first known bishop of Cologne. The city was the capital of a Roman province until it was occupied by the [[Ripuarian Franks]] in 462. Parts of the original Roman sewers are preserved underneath the city, with the [[Cologne sewerage system|new sewerage system]] having opened in 1890.

===Middle Ages===
Early medieval Cologne was part of [[Austrasia]] within the [[Frankish Empire]]. In 716, [[Charles Martel]] commanded an army for the first time and suffered the only defeat of his life when [[Chilperic II]], King of [[Neustria]], invaded Austrasia and the city fell to him in the [[Battle of Cologne]]. Charles fled to the [[Eifel]] mountains, rallied supporters and took the city back that same year after defeating Chilperic in the [[Battle of Amblève]]. Cologne had been the seat of a bishop since the Roman period; under [[Charlemagne]], in 795, bishop [[Hildebold]] was promoted to [[archbishop]].&lt;ref name="Cologne History"/&gt; In the 843 [[Treaty of Verdun]] Cologne fell into the dominion of [[Lothair I]]'s [[Middle Francia]] – later called [[Lotharingia]] ([[Lower Lorraine]]).

In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power when bishop [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne|Bruno]] was appointed as duke by his brother [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]], [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]]. In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his archiepiscopal successors with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[Jülich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]]. By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was [[Archchancellor]] of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.

Following the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced to reside in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;Harry de Quetteville. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, the sentence for which was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge known as the "Greve". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Besides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's archbishop, [[Rainald of Dassel]], gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been taken from [[Milan]]).

Cologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west as well as the main south–north Western Europe trade route, Northern Italy to Flanders. The intersection of these trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000–55,000.&lt;ref&gt;''The Population of European Cities'', Bairoch&lt;/ref&gt; Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.&lt;ref name="Cologne History"/&gt;

[[File:Rekonstruktion der Stadt Köln im 17. Jahrhundert.webm|thumb|Reconstruction of Cologne in the 17th century (German, English subtitles available)]]
The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.

As a [[free imperial city]], Cologne was a self-ruling state within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], an [[imperial estate]] with seat and vote at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], and as such had the right (and obligation) to contribute to the defense of the Empire and maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the Holy Roman Empire ("Reichskontingent") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken – Kölsche Funke rut-wieß vun 1823 e.V. – Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |access-date=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free Imperial City of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Electorate of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the Holy Roman Empire. Since the second half of the 16th century the majority of archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Brühl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Brühl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.

===From the 19th century until World War II===

[[File:Hängebrücke - Köln (1).tif|thumb|Hängebrücke]]
Cologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|Département]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Jülich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].

The permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.

During the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&amp;nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.

Cologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].&lt;ref name=USM&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&amp;pg=PA254&amp;id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835&lt;/ref&gt; It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Liège]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung Köln |access-date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.

During [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 15 February 1926&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.

As part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Grüngürtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at Müngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].

The democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archive-date=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |date=11 February 2008 |access-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919–1933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |access-date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.

===World War II===
[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]
During World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Militärbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[Münster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[Jülich]], [[Düren]], and [[Monschau]]. Cologne was home to the 211th Infantry Regiment and the 26th Artillery Regiment.

The Allies dropped 44,923.2 tons of bombs on the city during World War II, destroying 61% of its built up area. During the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II]], Cologne endured 262 air raids&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=koelnarchitektur |url=http://www.koelnarchitektur.de/pages/de/home/news_archiv/823.htm |title=on the reconstruction of Cologne |publisher=Koelnarchitektur.de |date=15 July 2003 |access-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Western [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which caused approximately 20,000 civilian casualties and almost completely wiped out the central part of the city. During the night of 31 May 1942, Cologne was the target of "[[Operation Millennium]]", the first 1,000 bomber raid by the [[Royal Air Force]] in World War&amp;nbsp;II. 1,046 heavy bombers attacked their target with 1,455 tons of explosives, approximately two-thirds of which were incendiary.&lt;ref&gt;Tourtellot, Arthur B. et al. ''Life's Picture History of World War&amp;nbsp;II'', p. 237. ''Time'', Inc., New York, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; This raid lasted about 75 minutes, destroyed {{convert|600|acre|ha|0}} of built-up area (61%),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/hamburg/sources/docs/6/&lt;/ref&gt; killed 486 civilians and made 59,000 people homeless. The devastation was recorded by [[Hermann Claasen]] from 1942 until the end of the war, and presented in his exhibition and book of 1947 ''Singing in the furnace. Cologne – Remains of an old city''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Claasen, Hermann | author2=Hoyer, Franz A | title=Gesang im feuerofen : Köln; überreste einer alten deutschen stadt | date=1949 | publisher=L.

&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, the population of Cologne had been reduced by 95 percent. This loss was mainly caused by a massive evacuation of the people to more rural areas. The same happened in many other German cities in the last two years of war. By the end of 1945, however, the population had already recovered to approximately 450,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Cologne-Germany/History#ref10814&lt;/ref&gt;
By the end of the war, essentially all of Cologne's pre-war [[Jewish]] population of 11,000 had been deported or killed by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Serup-Bilfeld, Zwischen Dom und Davidstern. Jüdisches Leben in Köln von den Anfängen bis heute. Köln 2001, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; The six synagogues of the city were destroyed.

===Post-war Cologne until today===
[[File:Cologne by Sentinel-2, 2020-05-07.jpg|thumb|Cologne, seen from ESA Sentinel-2]]
Despite Cologne's status as the largest city in the region, nearby [[Düsseldorf]] was chosen as the political capital of the [[States of Germany|federated state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]. With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became–and still is–home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.

In 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the "world's greatest heap of rubble". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.

The destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&amp;nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&amp;nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&amp;nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&amp;nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the Gürzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&amp;nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.

In 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&amp;nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&amp;nbsp;million again.

===Post-reunification===

In the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strong visual focal point in Cologne's city centre and includes the ''KölnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.

Due to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.

Cologne was the focus of the [[2015-16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany]], with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|title=Tensions rise in Germany over handling of mass sexual assaults in Cologne|last=Connolly|first=Kate| newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016|access-date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waz2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|title=1075 Anzeigen nach Kölner Silvesternacht – 73 Verdächtige|trans-title=1,075 assaults by Cologne New Year's Eve – 73 suspects|work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=de|access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Located in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] area, Cologne is one of the warmest cities in Germany. It has a [[Temperateness|temperate]]–[[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen: ''Cfb'']]) with cool winters and warm summers. It is also one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, with just 1567.5 hours of sun a year. Its average annual temperature is {{convert|11.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}: {{convert|16.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|6.3|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In January, the mean temperature is {{convert|5.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the mean temperature in August is {{convert|19.7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The record high temperature of 40C (104F) happened on 25 July 2019 during the [[July 2019 European heat wave]] in which Cologne saw three consecutive days over 38C (100F). Temperatures can vary significantly over the course of a month with warmer and colder weather. Precipitation is spread evenly throughout the year with a light peak in summer due to showers and thunderstorms.

There were 546,498 women and 522,694 men in Cologne. For every 1,000 males, there were 1,046 females. In 2015, there were 11,337 births in Cologne (of which 34.53% were to unmarried women); 7,704 marriages and 2,203 divorces, and 9,629 deaths. In the city, the population was spread out, with 15.6% under the age of 18, and 17.6% were 65 years of age or older. 163 people in Cologne were over the age of 100.&lt;ref name="stadt-koeln_2016-02-01"/&gt;

===Language===
{{See also|Colognian dialect}}
'''Colognian''' or '''Kölsch''' ({{IPA-ksh|kœɫːʃ}}) (natively ''Kölsch Platt'') is a small set of very closely related dialects, or variants, of the [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] [[Central German]] group of languages. These dialects are spoken in the area covered by the Archdiocese and former [[Electorate of Cologne]] reaching from [[Neuss]] in the north to just south of [[Bonn]], west to [[Düren]] and east to [[Olpe, Germany|Olpe]] in the North-West of [[Germany]]. Kölsch is one of the very few city dialects in Germany, which also include the [[Berlinerisch dialect|dialect]] spoken in [[Berlin]], for example.

===Religion===
As of 2015, 35.5% of the population belonged to the [[Catholic Church]], the largest religious body, and 15.5% to the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]].&lt;ref name="stadt-koeln_2016-02-012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/politik-und-verwaltung/statistik/jahrbuecher|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch 2016|date=1 February 2016|publisher=stadt-koeln.de|access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] claimed that Christianity was brought to Cologne by Roman soldiers and traders at an unknown early date. It is known that in the early second century it was a bishop's seat. The first historical Bishop of Cologne was [[Maternus of Cologne|Saint Maternus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.knight.org/cathen/04116a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Cologne|website=knight.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] studied in Cologne in 1244 under [[Albertus Magnus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_aquinas.html|title=St. Thomas Aquinas &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=philosophybasics.com|access-date=20 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cologne is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne]].

According to the 2011 census, 2.1% of the population was [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], 0.5% was member of an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Free Church]] and 4.2% belonged to further religious communities officially recognized by the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (such as [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]).&lt;ref name="Census_2011_Reli"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ergebnisse.zensus2011.de/#StaticContent:053150000000,BEG_4_2_6,m,table |title=Zensus 2011: Bevölkerung im regionalen Vergleich nach Religion (ausführlich) in % |access-date=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.personenstandsrecht.de/Webs/PERS/DE/informationen/religionsgemeinschaften/_documents/kirche_nrw.html |title=Nordrhein-Westfalen: Religions- und Weltanschauungsgemeinschaften, die auf Landesebene den Status "Körperschaft des öffentlichen Rechts" besitzen. |access-date=22 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several mosques, including the [[Cologne Central Mosque]] run by the [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs]]. In 2011, about 11.2% of the population was [[Islam|Muslim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kartenseite.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/brd_muslime_in_den_grossstaedten_beim_zensus2011_sortiert_nach_regionalschluessel1.pdf |title=Muslime in den Großstädten beim Zensus 2011 |access-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219230456/https://kartenseite.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/brd_muslime_in_den_grossstaedten_beim_zensus2011_sortiert_nach_regionalschluessel1.pdf |archive-date=19 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cologne also has one of the oldest and largest [[Judaism|Jewish]] communities in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1684525,00.html|title=Cologne: Germany's Oldest Jewish Community|last=Serup-Bilfeldt|first=Kirsten|date=19 August 2005|newspaper=[[Deutsche Welle]]|access-date=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, 0.3% of Cologne's population was Jewish.&lt;ref name="Census_2011_Reli"/&gt;

==Government==
{{See also|Cologne City Hall}}
The city's administration is headed by the [[List of mayors of Cologne|mayor]] and the three deputy mayors.

===Political traditions and developments===
The long tradition of a free imperial city, which long dominated an exclusively Catholic population and the age-old conflict between the church and the bourgeoisie (and within it between the patricians and craftsmen) have created its own political climate in Cologne. Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a "waste scandal" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.

===Mayor===
The Lord Mayor of Cologne is [[Henriette Reker]]. She received 52.66% of the vote at the municipal election on 17 October 2015 and was appointed on 15 December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://wahlen.stadt-koeln.de/prod/OB2015/05315000/html5/Oberbuergermeisterwahl_Gemeinde_Stadt_Koeln.html|title = Oberbürgermeisterwahl – Wahl des/der Oberbürgermeisters/in 2015 in der Stadt Köln – Gesamtergebnis|access-date = 18 October 2015|website = stadt-koeln.de|language = de|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151020160002/http://wahlen.stadt-koeln.de/prod/OB2015/05315000/html5/Oberbuergermeisterwahl_Gemeinde_Stadt_Koeln.html|archive-date = 20 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
City Councillors are elected for a five-year term and the Mayor has a six-year term.&lt;ref name="Election 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahlperiode|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/1/wahlen/abisz/03612/|access-date=15 April 2011|publisher=City of Cologne|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner city of Cologne was completely destroyed during World War&amp;nbsp;II. The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the "Wiederaufbauzeit" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ay8mnbMwYesC&amp;pg=PT35|title=Heidi Klum &amp; Seal The truth about the divorce|last=Hombach|first=Jean-Pierre|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4716-2190-1|pages=31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.

Green areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=KölnTourismus|access-date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
The presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds. [[Pigeon]]s are the most often seen animals in Cologne, although the number of birds is augmented each year by a growing population of [[Feral organism|feral]] exotics, most visibly [[parrots]] such as the [[rose-ringed parakeet]]. The sheltered climate in southeast [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species. The plumage of Cologne's green [[parrots]] is highly visible even from a distance, and contrasts starkly with the otherwise muted colours of the cityscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In NRW behaupten sich immer mehr exotische Vögel|url=http://www.rp-online.de/wissen/leben/in-nrw-behaupten-sich-immer-mehr-exotische-voegel-1.2313710|publisher=RP Online|access-date=16 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism==
Cologne had 5.8&amp;nbsp;million overnight stays booked and 3.35&amp;nbsp;million arrivals in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cologne-tourism.com/newsroom/press-releases/press-release/article/tourism-results-for-2016-moderate-decrease-in-visitor-numbers-due-to-difficult-general-conditions.html |title=Tourism results for 2016: Moderate decrease in visitor numbers due to difficult general conditions |publisher=KölnTourismus |date=21 February 2017 |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city also has the most pubs per capita in Germany.&lt;ref name="Nightlife"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nightlife|url=http://www.cologne.de/what-to-do/nightlife|publisher=KölnTourismus|access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has 70 clubs, "countless" bars, restaurants, and pubs.&lt;ref name="Nightlife"/&gt;

===Landmarks===

====Churches====
* [[Cologne Cathedral]] (German: ''Kölner Dom'') is the city's most famous monument and the Cologne residents' most loved landmark. It is a [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] church, started in 1248, and completed in 1880. In 1996, it was designated a [[World Heritage site]]; it houses the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]], which supposedly contains the [[relic]]s of the [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] (see also&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |title=Offizielle Webseite des Kölner Doms &amp;#124; Bedeutende Werke |publisher=Koelner-dom.de |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703064357/http://www.koelner-dom.de/index.php?id=dreikoenigenschrein |archive-date=3 July 2009 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Residents of Cologne sometimes refer to the cathedral as "the eternal construction site" (''die ewige Baustelle'').
* [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]]: These buildings are outstanding examples of medieval church architecture. The origins of some of the churches go back as far as Roman times, for example St.&amp;nbsp;Gereon, which was originally a chapel in a Roman graveyard. With the exception of St. Maria Lyskirchen all of these churches were very badly damaged during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Reconstruction was only finished in the 1990s.

Other famous buildings include the Gürzenich, Haus Saaleck and the Overstolzenhaus.

Of the twelve medieval [[city gate]]s that once existed, only the Eigelsteintorburg at Ebertplatz, the Hahnentor at Rudolfplatz and the Severinstorburg at Chlodwigplatz still stand today.

===Streets===
{{Main|Streets in Cologne}}
* The [[Cologne Ring]] boulevards (such as ''Hohenzollernring'', ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ring'', ''Hansaring'') with their medieval city gates (such as ''Hahnentorburg'' on ''Rudolfplatz'') are also known for their night life.
* [[Hohe Straße]] (literally: ''High Street'') is one of the main shopping areas and extends past the cathedral in an approximately southerly direction. The street contains many gift shops, clothing stores, fast food restaurants and electronic goods dealers.
* [[Schildergasse]] – connects ''Neumarkt'' square at its western end to the ''Hohe Strasse'' shopping street at its eastern end and has been named the busiest shopping street in Europe with 13,000 people passing through every hour, according to a 2008 study by [[GfK]].
* Ehrenstraße – the shopping area around ''Apostelnstrasse'', ''Ehrenstrasse'', and ''Rudolfplatz'' is a little more on the quirky and stylish side.

===Bridges===
[[File:Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River.jpg|thumb|left |Bridge in Cologne over the Rhine River.]][[File:Rhine River at Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|right|Rhine River at Cologne, Germany.]]Several bridges cross the Rhine in Cologne. They are (from south to north): the [[Cologne Rodenkirchen Bridge]], [[South Bridge (Cologne)|South Bridge]] (railway), Severin Bridge, Deutz Bridge, [[Hohenzollern Bridge]] (railway), Zoo Bridge (''Zoobrücke'') and [[Cologne Mülheim Bridge]]. In particular the iron [[tied arch bridge|tied arch]] Hohenzollern Bridge (''Hohenzollernbrücke'') is a dominant landmark along the river embankment. A Rhine crossing of a special kind is provided by the [[Cologne Cable Car]] (German: ''Kölner Seilbahn''), a cableway that runs across the Rhine between the [[Cologne Zoological Garden]] in Riehl and the [[Rheinpark]] in Deutz.

Cologne has [[List of museums in Cologne|several museums]]. The famous [[Roman-Germanic Museum]] features art and architecture from the city's distant past; the [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]] in Europe, including a [[Picasso]] collection matched only by the museums in [[Museu Picasso|Barcelona]] and [[Musée Picasso|Paris]]. The [[Museum Schnütgen]] of religious art is partly housed in St.&amp;nbsp;Cecilia, one of Cologne's [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]].
Many art galleries in Cologne enjoy a worldwide reputation like e.g. [[Galerie Karsten Greve]], one of the leading galleries for postwar and contemporary art.

Several orchestras are active in the city, among them the [[Gürzenich Orchestra]], which is also the orchestra of the [[Cologne Opera]] and the [[WDR Symphony Orchestra Cologne]] (''German State Radio Orchestra''), both based at the Cologne Philharmonic Orchestra Building ([[Kölner Philharmonie]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6  |title=Kölner Philharmonie |date=11 December 2007 |access-date=8 August 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071211142559/http://www.koelner-philharmonie.de/en/00_home/00_home.php?Style=eb281b060898acfab42beae0870f44f6 |archive-date = 11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other orchestras are the [[Musica Antiqua Köln]] and the [[WDR Rundfunkorchester Köln]], and several choirs, including the [[WDR Rundfunkchor Köln]]. Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio für elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Latäng'' (the student quarter around the Zülpicher Straße) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.

[[File:Water feature in Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Water feature in Cologne, Germany, summer of 2017.]]The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich Böll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].

Cologne is well known for its beer, called [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]]. [[Colognian language|Kölsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of Kölsch being the only language one can drink.

Cologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''Kölnisch Wasser''; lit: "Water of Cologne"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm Mülhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and Mühlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand Mülhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[Mäurer &amp; Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.

===Carnival===
The [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called "Tolle Tage" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Zülpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archive-date=25 January 2008 |title=Carnival – Cologne's "fifth season" – Cologne Sights &amp; Events – Stadt Köln |date=26 January 2008 |access-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry with Düsseldorf===
Cologne and [[Düsseldorf]] have a "fierce regional rivalry",&lt;ref name="Rivalry"&gt;{{cite news|title=Giving Beer A Home in the Rhineland|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110728-36597.html|access-date=28 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Local]]|date=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival]] parades, [[Association football|football]], and beer.&lt;ref name="Rivalry"/&gt; People in Cologne prefer [[Kölsch (beer)|Kölsch]] while people in Düsseldorf prefer [[Altbier]] ("Alt").&lt;ref name="Rivalry"/&gt; Waiters and patrons will "scorn" and make a "mockery" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or Kölsch in Düsseldorf.&lt;ref name="Rivalry"/&gt; The rivalry has been described as a "love–hate relationship".&lt;ref name="Rivalry"/&gt;

==Transport==
{{Main|Transport in Cologne}}

===Road transport===
[[File:Koelner Ring.png|thumb|left|Major [[List of streets in Cologne|roads through and around Cologne]]]]
Road building had been a major issue in the 1920s under the leadership of mayor [[Konrad Adenauer]]. The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstraße ("Federal Road") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobrücke'' ("Zoo Bridge") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&amp;nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&amp;nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-Süd-Fahrt'' ("North-South-Drive") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.

In 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&amp;nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.

===Cycling===

[[File:146 019-5 Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at [[Köln Hauptbahnhof]]]]

Compared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]]. It has repeatedly ranked among the worst in an independent evaluation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/adfc-startet-fahrradklima-test/adfc-fahrradklima-test-2014 |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304204535/http://www.adfc.de/fahrradklima-test/adfc-startet-fahrradklima-test/adfc-fahrradklima-test-2014 |archive-date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the [[Allgemeiner Deutscher Fahrrad-Club]]. In 2014 it ranked 36th out of 39 German cities with a population greater than 200,000.

===Rail transport===
Cologne has a railway service with [[Deutsche Bahn]] [[InterCity]] and [[InterCityExpress|ICE]]-trains stopping at ''[[Köln Hauptbahnhof]]'' (Cologne Main Station), ''[[Köln Messe/Deutz station|Köln Messe/Deutz]]'' and ''[[Cologne/Bonn Airport station|Cologne/Bonn Airport]]''. ICE and [[Thalys|TGV Thalys]] high-speed trains link Cologne with [[Amsterdam]], Brussels (in 1h47, 9 departures/day) and Paris (in 3h14, 6 departures/day). There are frequent ICE trains to other German cities, including [[Frankfurt am Main]] and Berlin. ICE Trains to London via the [[Channel Tunnel]] were planned for 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/travel/travel-news/highspeed-trains-to-link-england-and-germany-20111013-1lmq8.html |title=High-speed trains to link England and Germany |work=Brisbane Times |date=16 October 2011 |access-date=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cologne Stadtbahn]] operated by [[Kölner Verkehrs-Betriebe|Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe]] (KVB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvb-koeln.de/ |title=Kölner Verkehrsbetriebe (KVB) |publisher=Kvb-koeln.de |access-date=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[List of Cologne KVB stations|extensive]] [[light rail]] system that is partially underground and serves Cologne and a number of neighbouring cities. It evolved from the [[tram]] system. Nearby [[Bonn]] is linked by both the Stadtbahn and main line railway trains, and occasional recreational boats on the Rhine. [[Düsseldorf]] is also linked by [[S-Bahn]] trains, which are operated by Deutsche Bahn.

The [[Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn]] has 5 lines which cross Cologne.The S13/S19 runs 24/7 between Cologne Hbf and Cologne/Bonn airport.

There are also frequent buses covering most of the city and surrounding suburbs, and [[Eurolines]] coaches to London via [[Brussels]].

===Water transport===
''[[Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln]]'' (Ports and Goods traffic Cologne, HGK) is one of the largest operators of [[inland port]]s in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hgk.de/neu/english/contents/HGK_ports_cargo-handling-points.html |title=Häfen und Güterverkehr Köln AG |publisher=Hgk.de |access-date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ports include Köln-Deutz, Köln-Godorf, and Köln-Niehl&amp;nbsp;I and II.

===Air transport===
Cologne's international airport is [[Cologne Bonn Airport|Cologne/Bonn Airport]] (CGN). It is also called Konrad Adenauer Airport after Germany's first post-war Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]], who was born in the city and was [[mayor of Cologne]] from 1917 until 1933. The airport is shared with the neighbouring city of [[Bonn]]. Cologne is headquarters to the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA).

'''Carl Barks''' (March 27, 1901&amp;nbsp;– August 25, 2000) was an American [[cartoonist]], author, and painter. He is best known for his work in [[Disney comics|Disney comic books]], as the writer and artist of the first [[Donald Duck]] stories and as the creator of [[Scrooge McDuck]]. He worked anonymously until late in his career; fans dubbed him '''The Duck Man''' and '''The Good Duck Artist'''. In 1987, Barks was one of the three inaugural inductees of the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]].

Barks worked for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Studio]] and [[Western Publishing]] where he created [[Duckburg]] and many of its inhabitants, such as [[Scrooge McDuck]] (1947), [[Gladstone Gander]] (1948), the [[Beagle Boys]] (1951), [[The Junior Woodchucks]] (1951), [[Gyro Gearloose]] (1952), [[Duck family (Disney)#Cornelius Coot|Cornelius Coot]] (1952), [[Flintheart Glomgold]] (1956), [[John D. Rockerduck]] (1961) and [[Magica De Spell]] (1961). [[Will Eisner]] called him "the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] of comic books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fantagraphics.com/images/stories/books/wddd01/donald-blad.pdf |title=A Timeless Classic For All Ages - Fantagraphics Books|year=2011|publisher=Fantagraphics|access-date=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Barks was born in [[Merrill, Oregon|Merrill]], [[Oregon]], to William Barks and his wife, Arminta Johnson. He had an older brother named Clyde. His paternal grandparents were David Barks and his wife Ruth Shrum. Barks' maternal grandparents were Carl Johnson and his wife, Suzanna Massey, but little else is known about his ancestors. Barks was the descendant of Jacob Barks, who came to [[Missouri]] from [[North Carolina]] ''circa'' 1800. They lived in [[Marble Hill, Missouri|Marble Hill]] in [[Bollinger County, Missouri|Bollinger County]]. Jacob Barks' son Isaac was the father of the David Barks noted above.&lt;ref&gt;Source: 1850 census; ''Goodspeed's History of Southeast Missouri'', Southern Historical Press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
According to Barks's description of his childhood, he was a rather lonely child. His parents owned one square mile (2.6&amp;nbsp;km²) of land that served as their farm. The nearest neighbor lived half a mile (800 m) away, but he was more an acquaintance to Barks's parents than a friend. The closest school was about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} away and Barks had to walk that distance every day. The rural area had few children, though, and Barks later remembered that his school had only about eight or ten students including him. He had high praise for the quality of the education he received in that small school. "Schools were good in those days," he used to say.
The lessons lasted from nine o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon and then he had to return to the farm. There he remembered not having anybody to talk to, as his parents were busy and he had little in common with his brother.

In 1908, William Barks (in an attempt to increase the family income) moved with his family to [[Midland, Oregon]], some miles north of Merrill, to be closer to the new railway lines. He established a new stock-breeding farm and sold his produce to the local slaughterhouses.

Nine-year-old Clyde and seven-year-old Carl worked long hours there. But Carl later remembered that the crowd which gathered at Midland's market place made a strong impression on him. This was expected, as he was not used to crowds up until then. According to Barks, his attention was mostly drawn to the [[cowboy]]s that frequented the market with their revolvers, strange nicknames for each other and sense of humor.

By 1911, they had been successful enough to move to [[Santa Rosa, California]]. There they started cultivating vegetables and set up some orchards. Unfortunately, the profits were not as high as William expected and they started having financial difficulties. William's anxiety over them was probably what caused his first nervous breakdown.

As soon as William recovered, he made the decision to move back to Merrill. The year was 1913, and Barks was already 12-years-old; but, due to the constant moving, he had not yet managed to complete grade school. He resumed his education at this point and finally managed to graduate in 1916.

1916 served as a turning point in Barks's life for various reasons. First, Arminta, his mother, died in this year. Second, his hearing problems, which had already appeared earlier, had at the time become severe enough for him to have difficulties listening to his teachers talking. His hearing would continue to get worse later, but at that point he had not yet acquired a hearing aid. Later in life, he couldn't do without one. Third, the closest high school to their farm was {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} away and even if he did enroll in it, his bad hearing was likely to contribute to his learning problems. He had to decide to stop his school education, much to his disappointment.

===From job to job===
Barks started taking various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, stubborn and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At the same time he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later he would say it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]] and his own [[Scrooge McDuck]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Donald's drifting from job to job was reportedly inspired by Barks's own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this was another thing he was familiar with.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Scrooge's main difference to Donald, according to Barks, was that he too had faced the same difficulties in his past but through intelligence, determination and hard work, he was able to overcome them. Or, as Scrooge himself would say to [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]]: by being "tougher than the toughies and smarter than the smarties." In Barks's stories Scrooge would work to solve his many problems, even though the stories would often point out that his constant efforts seemed futile at the end. In addition, Scrooge was quite similar to his creator in appearing often to be as melancholic, introspective and secretive as he was.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Through both characters Barks would often exhibit his rather sarcastic sense of humor. It seems that this difficult period for the artist helped shape many of his later views in life that were expressed through his characters.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Professional artist===
At the same time Barks had started thinking about turning a hobby that he always enjoyed into a profession: that of drawing. Since his early childhood he spent his free time by drawing on any material he could find. He had attempted to improve his style by copying the drawings of his favorite [[comic strip]] artists from the newspapers where he could find them. As he later said, he wanted to create his own facial expressions, figures and comical situations in his drawings but wanted to study the master comic artists' use of the pen and their use of color and shading.

Among his early favorites were [[Winsor McCay]] (mostly known for ''[[Little Nemo]]'') and [[Frederick Burr Opper]] (mostly known for ''[[Happy Hooligan]]'') but he would later study any style that managed to draw his attention.

At age 16, he was mostly self-taught but at this point he decided to take some lessons through correspondence. He only followed the first four lessons and then had to stop because his working left him with little free time. But as he later said, the lessons proved very useful in improving his style.

By December 1918, he left his father's home to attempt to find a job in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He worked for a while in a small [[publishing house]] while attempting to sell his drawings to newspapers and other printed material with little success.

===First and second marriages===
While he continued drifting through various jobs, he met Pearl Turner (1904–1987). In 1921 they married and had two daughters:
* Peggy Barks (1923–1963)
* Dorothy Barks (1924–2014)

In 1923 he returned to his paternal farm in Merrill in an attempt to return to the life of a farmer, but that ended soon. He continued searching for a job while attempting to sell his drawings. He soon managed to sell some of them to ''Judge'' magazine and then started having success submitting to the Minneapolis-based ''Calgary Eye-Opener'', a racy men's cartoon magazine of the era. He was eventually hired as editor and scripted and drew most of the contents while continuing to sell occasional work to other magazines. His salary of $90 per month was considered respectable enough for the time. A facsimile of one of the racy magazines he did cartoons for in this period, ''Coo Coo'' #1, was published by Hamilton Comics in 1997.

Meanwhile, he had his first divorce. He and Pearl were separated in 1929 and divorced in 1930. After he moved to [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], where ''Calgary-Eye-Opener'' had its offices he met Clara Balken, who in 1938 became his second wife.

===Disney===
In November 1935, when he learned that Walt Disney was seeking more artists for his studio, Barks decided to apply. He was approved for a try-out which entailed a move to [[Los Angeles]], California. He was one of two in his class of trainees who was hired. His starting salary was 20 dollars a week. He started at [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney Studios]] in 1935, more than a year after the debut of Donald Duck on June 9, 1934, in the short animated film ''[[The Wise Little Hen]]''.

Barks initially worked as an [[Inbetweening|inbetweener]]. This involved being teamed and supervised by one of the head animators who did the key poses of character action (often known as extremes) for which the inbetweeners did the drawings between the extremes to create the illusion of movement. While an inbetweener, Barks submitted gag ideas for cartoon story lines being developed and showed such a knack for creating comical situations that by 1937 he was transferred to the story department. His first story sale was the climax of ''[[Modern Inventions]]'', for a sequence where a robot barber chair gives Donald Duck a haircut on his bottom.

In 1937 when Donald Duck became the star of his own series of cartoons instead of co-starring with [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Goofy]] as previously, a new unit of storymen and animators was created devoted solely to this series. Though he originally just contributed gag ideas to some duck cartoons by 1937 Barks was (principally with partner [[Jack Hannah]]) originating story ideas that were storyboarded and (if approved by Walt) put into production. He collaborated on such cartoons as ''[[Donald's Nephews]]'' (1938), ''[[Donald's Cousin Gus]]'' (1939), ''[[Mr. Duck Steps Out]]'' (1940), ''[[Timber (1941 film)|Timber]]'' (1941), ''[[The Vanishing Private]]'' (1942) and ''[[The Plastics Inventor]]'' (1944).

===The Good Duck Artist===
[[File:Interior page from Walt Disney's Comics and Stories.jpg|thumb|Omelet opening page]]
Unhappy at the emerging wartime working conditions at Disney, and bothered by ongoing sinus problems caused by the studio's air conditioning, Barks quit in 1942. Shortly before quitting, he moonlighted as a comic book artist, contributing half the artwork for a one-shot [[comic book]] (the other half of the art being done by story partner [[Jack Hannah]]) titled ''[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]''. This 64-page story was adapted by Donald Duck comic strip writer [[Bob Karp]] from an unproduced feature, and published in October 1942 in [[Dell Comics]] ''[[Disney comics#Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #9. It was the first Donald Duck story originally produced for an American comic book and also the first involving Donald and his nephews in a treasure hunting expedition, in this case for the treasure of [[Henry Morgan]]. Barks would later use the treasure hunting theme in many of his stories. This actually was not his first work in comics, as earlier the same year Barks along with Hannah and fellow storyman Nick George scripted ''[[Pluto Saves the Ship]]'', which was among the first original Disney comic book stories published in the United States.

After quitting the Disney Studio, Barks relocated to the [[Hemet, California|Hemet]]/[[San Jacinto, California|San Jacinto]] area in the semi-desert [[Inland Empire]] region east of Los Angeles where he hoped to start a chicken farm.

When asked which of his stories was a favorite in several interviews Barks cited the ten-pager in ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #146 (Nov. 1952) in which Donald tells the story of the chain of unfortunate events that took place when he owned a chicken farm in a town which subsequently was renamed Omelet. Likely one reason it was a favorite is that it was inspired by Barks' own experiences in the poultry business.

But to earn a living in the meantime he inquired whether [[Western Publishing]], which had published ''Pirate Gold'', had any need for artists for Donald Duck comic book stories. He was immediately assigned to illustrate the script for a ten-page Donald Duck story for the monthly ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]''. At the publisher's invitation he revised the storyline and the improvements impressed the editor sufficiently to invite Barks to try his hand at contributing both the script and the artwork of his follow-up story. This set the pattern for Barks' career in that (with rare exceptions) he provided art (pencil, inking, solid blacks and lettering) and scripting for his stories.

''[[The Victory Garden (comics)|The Victory Garden]]'', that initial ten-page story published in April, 1943 was the first of about 500 stories featuring the Disney ducks Barks would produce for Western Publishing over the next three decades, well into his purported retirement. These can be mostly divided into three categories:
* One-page gag stories like "[[Coffee for Two]]" and "[[Sorry to be Safe]]". These one-pagers were usually printed in black and white (or black and white and red) on the inside front, inside back, and outside back covers. These stories focused on one joke. 
* Ten-pagers, comedic Donald Duck stories that were the lead for the monthly flagship title ''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'', whose circulation peaked in the mid-1950s at 3 million copies sold a month.
* Humorous adventure stories, usually 24-32 pages in length. In the 1940s these were one-shots in the ''Four Color'' series (issued 4–6 times a year) that starred Donald and his nephews. Starting in the early 1950s (and through his retirement) Barks' longer stories were almost exclusively published in Uncle Scrooge's own quarterly title.

Barks' artistic growth during his first decade in comics saw a transformation from rather rudimentary storytelling derived from his years as an animation artist and storyman into a virtuoso creator of complex narratives, notably in his longer adventure tales. According to critic Geoffrey Blum, the process that saw its beginnings in 1942's Pirate Gold first bore its full fruit in 1950's "[[Vacation Time (1950)|Vacation Time]]," which he describes as "a visual primer for reading comics and understanding ... the form{{nbsp}}..."&lt;ref name="Barks and the Bending Panel"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Geoffrey|title=Barks and the Bending Panel|journal=The Carl Barks Library of Donald Duck Adventures in Color|year=c. 1990|issue=18|pages=[46]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He surrounded [[Donald Duck]] and nephews [[Huey, Dewey and Louie]] with a cast of eccentric and colorful characters, such as the aforementioned [[Scrooge McDuck]], the wealthiest [[duck]] in the world; [[Gladstone Gander]], Donald's obscenely lucky cousin; inventor [[Gyro Gearloose]]; the persistent [[Beagle Boys]]; the sorceress [[Magica De Spell]]; Scrooge's rivals [[Flintheart Glomgold]] and [[John D. Rockerduck]]; Daisy's nieces [[April, May and June]]; Donald's neighbor Jones, and [[The Junior Woodchucks]] organization.

Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or domestic comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises of everyday life with the nephews often acting as a [[Greek chorus]] commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. Yet while seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of [[Hal Foster]]'s ''[[Prince Valiant]]''.

===Third marriage===
As Barks blossomed creatively, his marriage to Clara deteriorated. This is the period referred to in Barks' famed quip that he could feel his creative juices flowing while the whiskey bottles hurled at him by a tipsy Clara flew by his head. They were divorced in 1951, his second and last divorce. In this period Barks dabbled in fine art, exhibiting paintings at local art shows. It was at one of these in 1952 he became acquainted with fellow exhibitor Margaret Wynnfred Williams (1917 – March 10, 1993), nicknamed Garé. She was an accomplished landscape artist, some of whose paintings are in the collection of the [[Leanin' Tree Museum of Western Art]]. During her lifetime, and to this day, note cards of her paintings are available from Leanin' Tree. Her nickname appears as a store name in the story "Christmas in Duckburg", featured on page 1 of Walt Disney's Christmas Parade #9, published in 1958. Soon after they met, she started assisting Barks, handling the solid blacks and lettering, both of which he had found onerous. They married in 1954 and the union lasted until her death.

===No longer anonymous===
People who worked for Disney (and its comic book licensees) generally did so in relative anonymity; stories would only carry Walt Disney's name and (sometimes) a short identification number. Prior to 1960 Barks' identity remained a mystery to his readers. However, many readers recognized Barks' work and drawing style and began to call him the Good Duck Artist, a label that stuck even after his true identity was discovered by fans in the late 1950s. Malcolm Willits was the first person to learn Barks's name and address, but two brothers named John and [[Bill Spicer]] became the first fans to contact Barks after independently discovering the same information. After Barks received a 1960 visit from the Spicer brothers and Ron Leonard, he was no longer anonymous, as word of his identity spread through the emerging network of comic book fandom [[fanzine]]s and [[comic book convention|conventions]].&lt;ref name="SpicerLetter"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbarks.dk/thefanletter.htm|title=THEFANLETTER|website=www.cbarks.dk|access-date=October 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===
[[File:Carl Barks signing autographs in Finland in 1994.jpg|Barks visiting Finland in June 1994|thumb]]
Carl Barks retired in 1966, but was persuaded by editor [[Chase Craig]] to continue to script stories for Western. The last new comic book story drawn by Carl Barks was a [[Daisy Duck]] tale ("The Dainty Daredevil") published in ''[[Walt Disney Comics Digest]]'' issue 5 (Nov. 1968). When bibliographer [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]] asked Barks why he drew it, Barks' vague recollection was no one was available and he was asked to do it as a favor by Craig.

He wrote one Uncle Scrooge story, three Donald Duck stories and from 1970–1974 was the main writer for the [[Junior Woodchucks]] comic book (issues 6 through 25). The latter included environmental themes that Barks first explored in 1957 ["Land of the Pygmy Indians", ''Uncle Scrooge'' #18]. Barks also sold a few sketches to Western that were redrawn as covers. For a time the Barkses lived in [[Goleta, California]], before returning to the Inland Empire by moving to [[Temecula, California|Temecula]].

To make a little extra money beyond what his pension and scripting earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings to sell at the local art shows where he and Garé exhibited. Subjects included humorous depictions of life on the farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendered paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks ("A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By", taken from the cover of ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact [[George Sherman (comics)|George Sherman]] at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbarks.dk/thecorrespondence1970s.htm|title=thecorrespondence1970s|website=www.cbarks.dk|access-date=October 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.

{{quote box |title=Ode to the Disney Ducks |source= —Carl Barks, 1999{{sfn|Blum|2008|page=293}} |width=270px |fontsize=80% |bgcolor=#eeffff
|quote=&lt;poem&gt;They ride tall ships to the far away,
and see the long ago.
They walk where fabled people trod,
and Yetis trod the snow.

They meet the folks who live on stars,
and find them much like us,
With food and love and happiness
the things they most discuss.

The world is full of clans and cults
abuzz as angry bees,
And Junior Woodchucks snapping jeers
at Littlest Chickadees.

The ducks show us that part of life
is to forgive a slight.
That black eyes given in revenge
keep hatred burning bright.

So when our walks in sun or shade
pass graveyards filled by wars,
It's nice to stop and read of ducks
whose battles leave no scars.

To read of ducks who parody
our vain attempts at glory,
They don't exist, but somehow leave
us glad we bought their story.&lt;/poem&gt;
}}

When Barks expressed dismay at coping with the backlog of orders he faced, fan/dealers Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran suggested Barks instead auction his paintings at conventions and via Cochran's catalog ''Graphic Gallery''. By September 1974 Barks had discontinued taking commissions.

At Boston's NewCon convention, in October 1975, the first Carl Barks oil painting auctioned at a comic book convention ("She Was Spangled and Flashy") sold for $2,500. Subsequent offerings saw an escalation in the prices realized.

In 1976, Barks and Garé went to Boston for the NewCon show, their first comic convention appearance. Among the other attendees was famed ''[[Little Lulu]]'' comic book scripter [[John Stanley (comics)|John Stanley]]; despite both having worked for [[Western Publishing]] this was the first time they met. The highlight of the convention was the auctioning of what was to that time the largest duck oil painting Barks had done, "July Fourth in Duckburg", which included depictions of several prominent Barks fans and collectors. It sold for a then record high amount: $6,400.

Soon thereafter a fan sold unauthorized prints of some of the Scrooge McDuck paintings, leading Disney to withdraw permission for further paintings. To meet demand for new work Barks embarked on a series of paintings of non-Disney ducks and fantasy subjects such as Beowulf and Xerxes. These were eventually collected in the limited-edition book ''Animal Quackers''.

As the result of heroic efforts by ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' producer [[Gary Kurtz]] and screenwriter [[Edward Summer]], Disney relented and, in 1981, allowed Barks to do a now seminal oil painting called "Wanderers of Wonderlands" for a breakthrough limited edition book entitled ''Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times''. The book collected 11 classic Barks stories of Uncle Scrooge colored by artist [[Peter Ledger]] along with a new Scrooge story by Barks done storybook style with watercolor illustrations, "Go Slowly, Sands of Time". After being turned down by every major publisher in New York City, Kurtz and Summer published the book through [[Celestial Arts]], which Kurtz acquired partly for this purpose. The book went on to become the model for virtually every important collection of comic book stories. It was the first book of its kind ever reviewed in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' and subsequently in ''[[Newsweek]]'', and the first book review in ''Time Magazine'' with large color illustrations.

In 1977 and 1982, Barks attended the San Diego Comic-Con. As with his appearance in Boston, the response to his presence was overwhelming, with long lines of fans waiting to meet Barks and get his autograph.

In 1981, Bruce Hamilton and Russ Cochran, two long-time Disney comics fans, decided to combine forces to bring greater recognition to the works of Carl Barks. Their first efforts went into establishing [[Another Rainbow]] Publishing, the banner under which they produced and issued the award-winning book ''The Fine Art of Walt Disney's Donald Duck by Carl Barks'', a comprehensive collection of the Disney duck paintings of this artist and storyteller. Not long after, the company began producing fine art lithographs of many of these paintings, in strictly limited editions, all signed by Barks, who eventually produced many original works for the series.

In 1983, Barks relocated one last time to [[Grants Pass, Oregon]],{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=xliv}} near where he grew up, partly at the urging of friend and ''[[Broom Hilda]]'' artist [[Russell Myers]], who lived in the area. The move also was motivated, Barks stated in another famous quip, by Temecula being too close to Disneyland and thus facilitating a growing torrent of drop-in visits by vacationing fans. In this period Barks made only one public appearance, at a comic book shop near Grants Pass.

In 1983, Another Rainbow took up the daunting task of collecting the entire Disney comic book oeuvre of Barks—over 500 stories in all—in the ten-set, thirty-volume ''[[Carl Barks Library]]''. These oversized hardbound volumes reproduced Barks' pages in pristine black and white line art, as close as possible to the way he would originally draw them, and included mountains of special features, articles, reminiscences, interviews, storyboards, critiques, and more than a few surprises. This monumental project was finally completed in mid-1990.

In 1985, a new division was founded, [[Gladstone Publishing]], which took up the then-dormant Disney comic book license. Gladstone introduced a whole new generation of Disney comic book readers to the wondrous storytelling of such luminaries as Barks, Paul Murry, and Floyd Gottfredson, as well as presenting the first works of modern Disney comics masters Don Rosa and William Van Horn. Seven years after Gladstone's founding, the ''Carl Barks Library'' was revived as the ''Carl Barks Library in Color'', a full-color, high-quality squarebound comic albums (including the first-ever Carl Barks trading cards).

From 1993 to 1998, Barks' career was managed by the "Carl Barks Studio" (Bill Grandey and Kathy Morby—they had sold Barks original art since 1979). This involved numerous art projects and activities, including a tour of 11 European countries in 1994, Iceland being the first foreign country he ever visited. Barks appeared at the first of many Disneyana conventions in 1993. Silk screen prints of paintings along with high-end art objects (such as original water colors, bronze figurines and ceramic tiles) were produced based on designs by Barks.

During the summer of 1994 and until his death, Barks and his studio personally assigned Peter Reichelt, a museum exhibition producer from [[Mannheim]], Germany, as his agent for Europe. Publisher "Edition 313" put out numerous lithographs. In 1997, tensions between Barks and the Studio eventually resulted in a lawsuit that was settled with an agreement that included the disbanding of the Studio. Barks never traveled to make another Disney appearance. He was represented by Ed Bergen, as he completed a final project. Gerry Tank and Jim Mitchell were to assist Barks in his final years.

During his Carl Barks Studio years, Barks created two more stories: the script for the final Uncle Scrooge story "Horsing Around with History", which was first published in Denmark in 1994 with Bill Van Horn art. The outlines for Barks' final Donald Duck story "Somewhere in Nowhere", were first published in 1997, in Italy, with art by Pat Block.

Austrian artist [[Gottfried Helnwein]] curated and organized the first solo museum-exhibition of Barks. Between 1994 and 1998 the retrospective was shown in ten European museums and seen by more than 400,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.helnwein.de/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_449.html# |title=Gottfried Helnwein "Wer ist Carl Barks?" |access-date=November 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204083810/http://www.helnwein.de/kuenstler/bibliografie/artikel_449.html# |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time in spring 1994, Reichelt and Ina Brockmann designed a special museum exhibition tour about Barks' life and work. Also represented for the first time at this exhibition were Disney artists [[Al Taliaferro]] and [[Floyd Gottfredson]]. Since 1995, more than 500,000 visitors have attended the shows in Europe.

Reichelt also translated Michael Barrier's biography of Barks into German and published it in 1994.

===Final days and death===
Barks spent his final years in a new home in [[Grants Pass, Oregon]], which he and Garé, who died in 1993, had built next door to their original home. In July 1999, he was diagnosed with [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]], a form of cancer arising from the [[white blood cell]]s in the [[bone marrow]], for which he received oral [[chemotherapy]]. However, as the disease progressed, causing him great discomfort, the ailing Barks decided to stop receiving treatment in June 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbarks.dk/thelastlettersb.htm Letter from caregiver Serene Hunicke (June 8, 2000)]. Carl Barks.dk. Retrieved on March 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his terminal condition, Barks remained, according to caregiver Serene Hunicke, ''"funny up to the end"''.

The year before, Barks, an [[atheist]], had told the university professor [[Donald Ault]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no apprehension, no fear of death. I do not believe in an afterlife. ... I think of death as total peace. You're beyond the clutches of all those who would crush you.{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=222}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On August 25, 2000, shortly after midnight, Carl Barks died quietly in his sleep at the age of 99.{{sfn|Ault|2003|page=xlvi}} He was interred in Hillcrest Memorial Cemetery in Grants Pass, beside Garé's grave.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbarks.dk/thefarewellgravesite.htm The Gravesite].

==Influence==
Barks' Donald Duck stories were rated #7 on [[The Comics Journal#The Journal's Top 100 Comics list|''The Comics Journal'' list of 100 top comics]]; his Uncle Scrooge stories were rated #20.

[[Steven Spielberg]] and [[George Lucas]] have acknowledged that the rolling-boulder booby trap in the opening scene of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' was inspired by the 1954 Carl Barks Uncle Scrooge adventure "The Seven Cities of Cibola" (''[[Uncle Scrooge]]'' #7). Lucas and Spielberg have also said that some of Barks' stories about space travel and the depiction of aliens had an influence on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas wrote the foreword to the 1982 ''Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times''. In it he calls Barks' stories "cinematic" and "a priceless part of our literary heritage".

The [[Walt Disney Treasures]] DVD set ''[[Walt Disney Treasures: Wave Five#The Chronological Donald, Volume 2|Chronological Donald, Volume 2]]'' includes a salute to Barks.

Carl Barks has an [[asteroid]] named after him, [[2730 Barks]].

The animated cartoon series ''[[DuckTales]]'' was largely inspired by Barks' duck stories, with several scripts based on his original comics. Barks himself enjoyed the first season, but was disappointed in later seasons as he didn't care for what he felt were "new made-up characters". Some of the stories{{clarify|date=January 2019}} became a sore spot with him too as they deviated from established storylines he had developed long ago. [[Mike Peraza]], a key Disney artist for the original series, has stated at conventions that Barks did like the show at least in the beginning, when they discussed it over dinner at [[Jack Hannah]]'s home.

In [[Almere]], [[Netherlands]], a street was named after him: Carl Barksweg. The same neighborhood also includes a Donald Ducklaan and a Goofystraat.

Japanese animator and cartoonist [[Osamu Tezuka]], who created [[manga]] such as ''[[Astro Boy]]'' and ''[[Black Jack (manga)|Black Jack]]'', was a fan of Barks' work. ''New Treasure Island'', one of Tezuka's first works, was partly influenced by "[[Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold]]".&lt;ref name=tcj.com&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/manga-finds-pirate-gold-the-case-of-new-treasure-island/ |title=Manga Finds Pirate Gold: The Case of ''New Treasure Island'' |last=Holmberg|first=Ryan|year=2012|publisher=The Comics Journal |access-date=September 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1949 Donald Duck ten-pager features Donald raising a yacht from the ocean floor by filling it with [[ping pong]] balls. In December 1965 [[Karl Krøyer]], a Dane, lifted the sunken freight vessel ''Al Kuwait'' in the Kuwait Harbor by filling the hull with 27 million tiny inflatable balls of [[polystyrene]].&lt;ref name=bpib&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starch.dk/isi/kroyer/schrooge.asp |title=Karl Kroyer - "The Sunken Yacht" by Carl Barks |access-date=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the suggestion is often made, Krøyer denies having been inspired by this Barks story. Some sources claim Krøyer was denied a Dutch patent registration (application number NL 6514306) for his invention on the grounds that the Barks story was a [[prior art|prior publication]] of the invention. However, no definite proof of this story is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iusmentis.com/patents/priorart/donaldduck/|title=The "Donald Duck as prior art" case (in Patents &gt; When is something prior art @ iusmentis.com)|website=www.iusmentis.com|access-date=October 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octrooicentrum.nl/actueel/nieuws/20060601-1.aspx |title=''Donald Duck verslaat uitvinder! donderdag'' 1 juni 2006 |access-date=2006-10-06 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075256/http://www.octrooicentrum.nl/actueel/nieuws/20060601-1.aspx |archive-date=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Krøyer later successfully raised another ship off Greenland using the same method, and several other sunken vessels worldwide have since been raised by modified versions of this concept. The television show ''[[MythBusters]]'' also tested this method and was able to raise a small boat.

For those currently drawing Disney Duck comics, the influence of Barks cannot be overstated. For artists such as [[Daan Jippes]] and [[Freddy Milton]], Barks' comics have made a great impact. [[Don Rosa]], one of the most popular living Disney artists, and possibly the one who has been most keen on connecting the various stories into a coherent universe and chronology, considers (with few exceptions) all Barks' duck stories as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], and all others as [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]]. Rosa has said that a number of novelists and movie-makers cite Carl Barks as their 'major influence and inspiration'.&lt;ref name=bpib-Don&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bpib.com/illustra2/barks2.htm |title=Don Rosa on Carl Barks' Conquest of Europe |last=Rosa |first=Don |year=2000 |access-date=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of Barks' work in Europe is high, and has been that way for years. When the news of Barks' passing was hardly covered by the press in America, "in Europe the sad news was flashed instantly across the airwaves and every newspaper&amp;nbsp;— they realized the world had lost one of the most beloved, influential and well-known creators in international culture."&lt;ref name=bpib/&gt;

In 2010 [[Oregon Cartoon Institute]] produced a video to educate the uninitiated about the influence of Carl Barks and [[Basil Wolverton]] on [[Robert Crumb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gliCE-vDNc0|title=Carl Barks + Basil Wolverton = Genius R. Crumb|access-date=October 4, 2019|via=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers]]'' is dedicated to the memory of Carl Barks.

Carl Barks drew an early [[Andy Panda]] comic book story published in ''New Funnies'' #76, 1943. It is one of his few stories to feature humans interacting with [[funny animal]] characters (another is ''Dangerous Disguise'', ''[[Disney comics#Four Color|Four Color]]'' #308, 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://inducks.org/story.php?c=W+OS++308-02|title=Dangerous Disguise (W OS 308-02) &amp;#124; I.N.D.U.C.K.S.|website=inducks.org|access-date=October 4, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;). See [[List of Fictional Pandas]].

The life story of Carl Barks, largely drawing upon his relationship with Disney and the phonetic similarity of his name to [[Karl Marx]], serves as a loose inspiration to one of the subplots in ''[[The Last Song of Manuel Sendero]]'' by [[Ariel Dorfman]], though his biography in this novel veers sharply into science fiction fantasy and symbolism.

The first image ever to be displayed on an [[Apple Macintosh]] was a scan of Carl Barks' Scrooge McDuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Scrooge_McDuck.txt&amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;detail=medium&amp;search=scrooge%20mcduck |title=Macintosh Stories : Scrooge McDuck by Andy Hertzfeld|access-date=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art materials==
Barks was an enthusiastic user of [[Esterbrook]] pens, and used a Nº 356 model to ink and letter his Donald Duck comic-book pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Mannheim is located at the confluence of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Neckar]] in the northwestern corner of Baden-Württemberg. The Rhine separates Mannheim from the city of [[Ludwigshafen]], just to the west of it in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and the border of Baden-Württemberg with [[Hesse]] is just to the north. Mannheim is downstream along the Neckar from the city of [[Heidelberg]].

Mannheim is unusual among German cities in that its streets and avenues are laid out in a grid pattern, leading to its nickname "die Quadratestadt" (''the Square City''). The eighteenth century [[Mannheim Palace]], former home of the [[Prince-elector]] of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Palatinate]], now houses the [[University of Mannheim]].

The city is home to major corporations including [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[John Deere]], [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]], [[Asea Brown Boveri|ABB]], [[Fuchs Petrolub]], [[IBM]], [[Hoffmann-La Roche|Roche]], [[Reckitt Benckiser]], [[Unilever]], [[Phoenix Pharmahandel|Phoenix Group]], [[Pepperl+Fuchs]], [[Siemens]], and several other well-known companies. In addition, Mannheim's [[SAP Arena]] is not only the home of the German ice hockey record champions the [[Adler Mannheim]], but also the well-known handball team, the [[Rhein-Neckar Löwen]]. Since 2014, Mannheim has been a member of the [[UNESCO]] Creative Cities Network and holds the title of "UNESCO City of Music".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rnz.de/mannheim/00_20141202060000_110796991-Mannheim-ist-jetzt-offiziell-Unesco-City-of-Mu.html|title=Mannheim ist jetzt offiziell "Unesco City of Music"|publisher=RNZ|access-date=2016-05-29|language=de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228150059/http://www.rnz.de/mannheim/00_20141202060000_110796991-Mannheim-ist-jetzt-offiziell-Unesco-City-of-Mu.html|archive-date=28 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mannheim is a [[smart city]];&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=The rise of the smart city|url=http://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/the-rise-of-the-smart-city|access-date=2014-03-23|publisher=The New Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city's [[electrical grid]] is installed with a [[power-line communication]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/19/tech/smart-grid-mannheim/|title=Smart City knows who needs power, and when|publisher=CNN|access-date=2016-05-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's tourism slogan is "Leben. Im Quadrat." (''Life. In the''{{efn|in dem → im}} ''Square.'') The civic symbol of Mannheim is ''der Wasserturm'' (''the Watertower''), a Romanesque [[water tower]] completed in 1886 that rises to {{convert|60|m|abbr=off}} above the highest point of the [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] area ''Friedrichsplatz''. Mannheim is the starting and finishing point of the [[Bertha Benz Memorial Route]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Mannheim}}

===Early history===
The name of the city was first recorded as ''Mannenheim'' in a legal transaction in 768, surviving in a twelfth-century copy in the ''[[Lorsch codex|Codex Laureshamensis]]'' from [[Lorsch Abbey]]. The name is interpreted as "the home of Manno", a short form of a [[Germanic name]] such as ''Hartmann'' or ''Hermann''.&lt;ref&gt;Sonja Steiner-Welz, ''400 Jahre Stadt Mannheim (Dokumente zur Stadtgeschichte). Band 1: bis zur Kaiserzeit'', vol. 1, 2004, {{ISBN|978-3-936041-96-5}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Mannheim remained a mere village throughout the Middle Ages.

===Early Modern Age===
In 1606, [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] started building the fortress of Friedrichsburg and the adjacent city centre with its grid of streets and avenues. On 24 January 1607, Frederick IV gave Mannheim the status of a "city", whether it really was one by then or not.

Mannheim was mostly levelled during the [[Thirty Years War]] around 1622 by the forces of [[Johan t'Serclaes, Count of Tilly|Johan Tilly]]. After being rebuilt, it was again severely damaged by the [[French Army]] in 1689 during the [[Nine Years' War]].

After the rebuilding of Mannheim that began in 1698, the capital of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] was moved from Heidelberg to Mannheim in 1720 when [[Karl III Philip, Elector Palatine]] began construction of Mannheim Palace and the [[Jesuit Church (Mannheim)|Jesuit Church]]; they were completed in 1760.

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:Mannheim 1758.jpg|thumb|180px|Mannheim in 1758]]
[[File:Stadtplan Mannheim 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Historical map of Mannheim in 1880]]
During the eighteenth century, Mannheim was the home of the "[[Mannheim School]]" of [[European classical music|classical music composers]]. Mannheim was said to have one of the best court orchestras in Europe under the leadership of the conductor [[Carlo Grua]]. The royal court of the Palatinate left Mannheim in 1778. Two decades later, in 1802, Mannheim was removed from the Palatinate and given to the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]].

In 1819, [[Norwich Duff]] wrote of Mannheim:
{{Quote box |quote = Mannheim is in the Duchy of Baden and situated at the confluence of the [[Rhine]] and [[Neckar]] over both of which there is a bridge of boats. This is the third town of this name having been twice burnt. The houses are large, and the streets broad and at right angles to each other, and is one of the most airy clean towns I have seen in Germany. It was formerly fortified, but the fortifications were razed in 1806 and gardens fill their places. There is a large [[château]] here belonging to the Grand Duke and a very good garden; part of the château was destroyed when the town was bombarded and has never since been repaired, the other part is occupied by the [[Stéphanie de Beauharnais|Grand Duchess, widow]] of the [[Karl, Grand Duke of Baden|late Grand Duke]] who was succeeded by [[Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden|his uncle]] having left only three daughters. She is the sister of [[Eugene Beauharnais]] [sic; in fact, she was his second cousin].

In 1819, [[August von Kotzebue]] was assassinated in Mannheim.

The [[Year Without a Summer|climate crisis of 1816-17]] caused famine and the death of many horses in Mannheim. That year [[Karl Drais]] invented the first bicycle.

Infrastructure improvements included the establishment of [[Mannheim Harbour|Rhine Harbour]] in 1828 and construction of the [[Mannheim–Karlsruhe–Basel railway|first Baden railway]], which opened from Mannheim to Heidelberg in 1840. Influenced by the economic rise of the middle class, another golden age of Mannheim gradually began. In the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|March Revolution of 1848]], the city was a centre for political and revolutionary activity.

In 1865, [[Friedrich Engelhorn]] founded the ''Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik'' (Baden Aniline and Soda Factory, [[BASF]]) in Mannheim, but the factory was constructed across the Rhine in Ludwigshafen because Mannheim residents feared [[air pollution]] from its operations. From this dye factory, BASF has developed into the largest chemical company in the world. After opening a workshop in Mannheim in 1871 and patenting engines from 1878, [[Karl Benz]] patented the first motor car in 1886. He was born in Mühlburg (now part of Karlsruhe).

===Early 20th century and World War I===
The [[List of Schütte-Lanz airships|Schütte-Lanz company]], founded by Karl Lanz and Johann Schütte in 1909, built 22 airships. The company's main competitor was the [[Zeppelin]] works.

When World War I broke out in 1914, Mannheim's industrial plants played a key role in Germany's war economy. This contributed to the fact that, on 27 May 1915, Ludwigshafen was the world's first civilian settlement behind the battle lines to be bombed from the air. French aircraft attacked the BASF plants, thereby killing twelve people. The precedent was set for this attack by Germany's repeated air raids against British civilian populations throughout southeastern Britain during the first half of 1915.

When Germany lost the war in 1918, according to the peace terms, the left bank of the Rhine was occupied by French troops. The French occupation lasted until 1930, and some of Ludwigshafen's most elegant houses were erected for the officers of the French garrison.

===Inter-war period===
After the First World War, the Heinrich Lanz Company built the Bulldog, an advanced tractor, powered by heavy oil. As a result of the invention of the pre-combustion chamber by [[Prosper L'Orange]], [[Benz &amp; Cie.]] developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at its motor works in Mannheim in 1923. In 1922, the ''Grosskraftwerk Mannheim'' (Mannheim large power station) was opened. By 1930, the city, along with its sister city of Ludwigshafen, which had developed out of the old Mannheim Rheinschanze, had a population of 385,000.

===World War II===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1971-053-59, Mannheim, US-Truppen im Straßenkampf.jpg|thumb|US troops in street fighting in Mannheim, 1945]]

During [[World War II]], [[Bombing of Mannheim in World War II |air raids on Mannheim]] completely destroyed the city centre. Mannheim was heavily damaged during [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and the [[U.S. Army Air Forces|U.S. Air Force]]. The RAF razed the city center of Mannheim with nighttime [[area bombing]], killing thousands of civilians. 2,262 of Mannheim's Jews were sent to concentration camps. Some sources state that the first deliberate [[terror bombing]] of the war occurred at Mannheim on 16 December 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8J2-kzMxbKYC&amp;q=%22Germany+and+the+Second+World+War%22+%22deliberate+terror%22+Mannheim&amp;pg=PA507 |title=Germany and the Second World War |date= 2001-11-15|access-date=2011-04-07|isbn=978-0-19-822888-2|last1=Boog |first1=Horst |last2=Rahn |first2=Werner |last3=Stumpf |first3=Reinhard |last4=Wegner |first4=Bernd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Mannheim in late March 1945, which was potentially well-defended by German forces. However, the German forces suddenly abandoned the city and the [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 44th Infantry Division]] entered unopposed on 29 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, Shelby, ''World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939-1946'' (Revised Edition, 2006), Stackpole Books.&lt;/ref&gt; There had been a large American military occupation presence in the Mannheim area with up to 10 barracks. The first one shut down in 2007 going on until 2013 when the last one closed. (See ''United States military installations'' below).

===1950s to 1980s===
[[File:Wasserturm Mannheim.jpg|thumb|right|The Wasserturm Garden]]
[[File:Victoria-Turm in Mannheim.jpg|thumb|left|Victoria Tower (''Victoria-Turm'')]]
Rebuilding of the city began laboriously. [[Mannheim Palace]] and the [[Mannheim water tower|water tower]] (''Wasserturm'') eventually were rebuilt and the [[National Theatre Mannheim|National Theatre]] was replaced by a new building at a new location. At the old location there is a monument to [[Friedrich Schiller]] and the ''Zum Zwischen-Akt'' pub. The housing shortage led to the development of many new residential areas.

In 1964, the City Hospital (''Städtische Krankenhaus'') became part of the [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Medicine in Mannheim|Neckar Faculty of Heidelberg University for Clinical Medicine in Mannheim]]. In 1967, the [[University of Mannheim]] was established in the city.

In 1975, the [[Bundesgartenschau]] (''Federal horticulture show'') was celebrated in [[Luisenpark|Luisen]] and Herzogenried parks. A number of pieces of infrastructure were developed for the show: the [[Fernmeldeturm Mannheim|telecommunications tower]] and a [[Kurt-Schumacher Bridge (Mannheim)|second bridge]] across the Rhine were built, the pedestrian zone was established, the new Rosengarten conference centre was opened and the [[Aerobus]] was installed as a temporary transport system.

A number of major projects were completed in the 1980s and 1990s: a planetarium, an extension to the art gallery, the new Reiß Museum, Stadthaus, a new [[Mannheim May Market|May Market]] ground, synagogue, mosque, [[Technoseum|State Museum for Technology and Work]], [[Carl-Benz-Stadion|Carl-Benz stadium]] and the Fahrlach tunnel were opened.

Mannheim has lost many industrial jobs, although in the recent past the city was economically dominated by manufacturing. The city tried in the past to prevent the establishment of service providers by designating some locations as industrial areas. A prime example of the current trend is the construction of the Victoria Tower (Victoria-Turm) in 2001, one of the tallest buildings in the city, on railway land.

===Post-reunification===
Mannheim celebrated its 400th anniversary with a series of cultural and other events throughout 2007. The 400th anniversary proper was in 2006, since [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] laid the foundations of Mannheim citadel on 17 March 1606. In preparation for the anniversary, some urban activities were implemented, beginning in 2000: the building of the [[SAP Arena]] with access to the city's new eastern ring road, the rehabilitation of the pedestrian zone in Breite Straße, the arsenal and the palace, the complete transformation of the old fair ground, and the new Schafweide tram line. The concept of the anniversary of the city aimed at a diverse range of events without a dominant central event.

==Inventions==
[[File:Monument of first motorcar.jpg|thumb|Monument of first motorcar in Mannheim]]
According to [[Forbes]] magazine, Mannheim is known for its exceptional inventive power and was ranked 11th among the Top 15 of the most inventive cities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2013/07/09/worlds-15-most-inventive-cities|title=World's 15 Most Inventive Cities|magazine=Forbes.com|access-date=2014-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/the-manhattan-of-germany-the-innovative-mannheim-city|title=The Manhattan of Germany: the innovative Mannheim city|publisher=The New Economy|access-date=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many important inventions were made in Mannheim:
*[[Karl Drais]] built the first two-wheeled ''[[draisine]]'' in 1817.
*[[Karl Benz]] drove the first automobile on the streets of Mannheim in 1886. At his workshop in Mannheim he produced a lightweight [[Benz Patent Motorwagen|three-wheeled vehicle]] powered by a single cylinder [[gasoline|petrol/gasoline]]-fueled [[internal combustion engine|engine]], first shown in public during 1886. This powered tricycle subsequently came to be widely regarded as the first [[automobile|automobile/motor car]] powered by an internal-combustion engine. Karl's wife [[Bertha Benz]] undertook the world's first [[road trip]] by automobile from Mannheim to [[Pforzheim]] in August 1888.
* The Lanz Bulldog, a popular tractor with a rugged, simple Diesel engine was introduced in 1921.
* Karl Benz developed the world's first compact diesel-powered car at the [[Benz &amp; Cie.]] motor works in Mannheim during 1923.
*[[Julius Hatry]] built the world's first rocket plane in 1929.

== Politics ==
===City council===
[[File:Technisches Rathaus in Mannheim.jpg|thumb|Town hall in E&amp;nbsp;5]]
[[File:Gemeinderat-Mannheim-2009.png|thumb|City council in 2009]]
The council has 48 seats and is elected by direct suffrage for five years. In the local elections in Baden-Württemberg, voters are allowed to take advantage of [[cumulative voting]] and [[Panachage|vote splitting]]. Since the Second World War the SPD, except in the elections of 1999 and 2004, has received more votes than the CDU. At the 2019  election the Greens received most votes for the first time. The next municipal election will take place in 2024.

The outcome of the local elections of 25 May 2019 and the current members of the council is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg |title=Stadt Mannheim: Gemeinderatswahl 2019 |url=https://web2.mannheim.de/Wahl2019/gw2019.html| access-date=9 August 2020| language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States military installations==
A number of [[U.S. Army Europe]] installations were located in and near Mannheim during the [[Cold War]]. The following locations provided services to and housed the "U.S. Army Garrison Mannheim" and other units of the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army Garrison Mannheim was formally deactivated on 31 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/article/59265/Mannheim_Deactivation_Ceremony/|title=Mannheim Deactivation Ceremony|author=USAG BADEN-WÜRTTEMBERG PUBLIC AFFAIRS|date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, it was the home of the [[Mannheim American High School]] and the Middle School,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mann-ms.eu.dodea.edu/|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923115250/http://www.mann-ms.eu.dodea.edu/|archive-date=23 September 2007|access-date=2007-06-07|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which closed on 9 June 2011. The last soldier and his family moved out in 2012.

The following locations were part of the "U.S. Army Garrison [[Heidelberg]]" but were within the area of the city of Mannheim; They were vacated in 2010 and 2011:

==Theatre==
The [[National Theatre Mannheim]] was founded in 1779 and is the oldest "Stage" in Germany. In 1782 the premier of ''Die Räuber'', written by [[Friedrich Schiller]], was shown.

Recently, more smaller stages have opened, such as the Oststadt-Theater, the TIG7 (Theater im Quadrat G7), the Theater Oliv, the Freilichtbühne, the Theater31, the Theater ImPuls, the Theater Felina-Areal, the Mannheimer Puppenspiele, the Kleinkunstbühne Klapsmühl', Schatzkistl, and [[zeitraumexit]].

==Education==
[[File:SchlossMannheim-Pano-130616.jpg|700 px|thumb|center|The University of Mannheim's main campus – the Palace in a 180-degree panoramic view]]
The [[University of Mannheim]] is one of Germany's younger universities. Although founded in 1967, it has its origins in the 1763-established Palatine Academy of Sciences and the former Handelshochschule. Situated in [[Mannheim Palace]], it is Germany's leading university in business and economics and attracts students from around the world. Described by [[Die Zeit|"Die Zeit" magazine]] as the 'Harvard of Germany' it is seen as the alma mater of German businessmen and women.

The university town also houses one of the medical schools of [[Heidelberg University]], the [[Hochschule Mannheim]], a branch of the [[Baden-Württemberg Cooperative State University|Duale Hochschule of the State of Baden-Württemberg]] and several musical and theatrical academies, including the Pop Academy Mannheim, the Musikhochschule and the Theaterakademie. These institutions draw a large and diverse student body.

Dependents of U.S. military personnel attended Mannheim Elementary School until it closed in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Casebeer, Elizabeth.

Mannheim is located in Germany's warmest summer region, the "[[Upper Rhine Plain|Rhine shift]]". In summer, temperatures sometimes rise up to {{convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on}} and higher. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|39.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 7 August 2015. The daily lows during heat waves can be very high by north European standards (around {{convert|25|°C|0|disp=x| / |abbr=on}}). In comparison to other regions of Germany, Mannheim has a higher humidity in summer which causes a higher heat index. Snow is rare, even in the cold months. Precipitation occurs mostly during afternoon thunderstorms during the warmer period (average days of thunderstorms in a year is 40–50). Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=82701&amp;cityname=Mannheim%2C+Baden-W%FCrttemberg%2C+Germany&amp;units=|title=Mannheim, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|work=Weatherbase}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
===Roads===
[[File:Mannheim-Strassenverkehr.png|Roadmap of Mannheim.|thumb]]

The Mannheim/Ludwigshafen area is surrounded by a ring of motorways connecting it to [[Frankfurt]] in the north, [[Karlsruhe]] in the south, [[Saarbrücken]] in the west and [[Nuremberg]] in the east.

===Railway===
[[Mannheim Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) is at the end of the [[Mannheim-Stuttgart high-speed rail line]] and is the most important railway junction in the southwest of Germany, served by [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] high-speed train system with connections to [[Frankfurt am Main]]–[[Berlin]], [[Karlsruhe]]–[[Basel]], and [[Stuttgart]]–[[Munich]]. A new [[Frankfurt–Mannheim high-speed railway|high speed line to Frankfurt]] also is planned to relieve the existing [[Mannheim–Frankfurt railway]].

===River transport===
{{Location mark|image=Neckar watershed closer.gif|caption=Mannheim on the rivers Rhine and Neckar|type=thumb|x=296|y=195}}
[[Mannheim Harbour]] is the second largest [[river port]] in Germany. It has a size of 1131 [[hectare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Millenet|first=Jan|date=2019-01-09|title=Mannheimer Binnenhafen ist einer der größten seiner Art|url=https://www.echo-online.de/lokales/nachrichten-rhein-neckar/mannheimer-binnenhafen-ist-einer-der-grossten-seiner-art_19886771|access-date=2020-09-09|website=www.echo-online.de|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
[[File:Flugplatz mannheim von mario-andreya.jpg|thumb|[[Mannheim City Airport]]]]
Although [[Frankfurt International Airport]] is only {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, at various times over the years there were daily passenger flights from [[Mannheim City Airport]] ([[IATA code]] MHG) to [[London]], [[Dresden]], [[Berlin]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], and [[Saarbrücken]]. Currently, scheduled commercial passenger flights serve Berlin and Hamburg.

===Local public transport===
{{See also|Trams in Mannheim/Ludwigshafen}}
Local public transport in Mannheim includes the [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]], eleven [[tram]] lines, and numerous bus lines operated by [[Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr]] (Rhine-Neckar transport) (RNV).

The [[RheinNeckar S-Bahn]], established in 2003, connects most of the Rhine-Neckar area including lines into the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], [[Odenwald]], and southern [[Hesse]]. All S-Bahn lines run through Mannheim Hauptbahnhof, except S5. Further S-Bahn stations are at present Mannheim-Rangierbahnhof, Mannheim-Seckenheim, and Mannheim-Friedrichsfeld-Süd.

The {{RailGauge|1000mm|allk=on}} integrated [[Trams in Mannheim/Ludwigshafen|Mannheim/Ludwigshafen tramway network]] also extends to Heidelberg. It is operated by RNV, a company wholly owned by the three cities mentioned and a couple of municipalities in the Palatinate. RNV is the result of a merger on 1 October 2009 between the region's five former municipal transportation companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.rnv-online.de/rnvGips/Gips;jsessionid=D599A53604ABB5F1D24D663A7F42FD3C?SessionMandant=RNV&amp;Anwendung=CMSTickerEintrag&amp;Methode=ShowHTMLAusgabe&amp;SessionMandant=&amp;RessourceID=56833 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20110719075638/http://www.rnv-online.de/rnvGips/Gips;jsessionid=D599A53604ABB5F1D24D663A7F42FD3C?SessionMandant=RNV&amp;Anwendung=CMSTickerEintrag&amp;Methode=ShowHTMLAusgabe&amp;SessionMandant=&amp;RessourceID=56833 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 19 July 2011 | title= Press release announcing the merger to form RNV (German-language)| date= 23 September 2009 | access-date= 2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interurban trams are operated by RNV on a triangular route between Mannheim, [[Heidelberg]], and [[Weinheim]] that was originally established by the [[Upper Rhine Railway Company]] (''Oberrheinische Eisenbahn'', OEG), and the company also operates interurban trams between [[Bad Dürkheim]], Ludwigshafen, and Mannheim. In the 1970s a proposal to build a [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] out of the Mannheim and Ludwigshafen tramways was begun, but only small sections were built due to lack of funds. The only underground station in Mannheim is the Haltestelle Dalbergstraße. U-Bahn planning now has stopped. All public transport is offered at uniform prices set by the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar]] (Rhine-Neckar transport union, VRN).

==Sport==
[[File:Carl-Benz-Stadion 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carl-Benz-Stadion]], the home stadium of [[SV Waldhof Mannheim]]]]

Liga]], but who have played in the top tier, the [[Bundesliga]]; and [[VfR Mannheim]], winner of the [[History of German football#Postwar football|German championship in 1949]], now playing in the sixth tier [[Verbandsliga Baden]].

The [[Adler Mannheim]] (formerly MERC, Mannheimer Eis- und Rollsport-Club) is an [[ice hockey]] team playing in the professional [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga]], having won the German championship a total of eight times (7 times Deutsche Eishockey Liga and one time the former highest German ice hockey league known as [[Eishockey-Bundesliga|Bundesliga]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Championnat d'Allemagne de hockey sur glace 1979/80|url=http://www.passionhockey.com/hockeyarchives/Allemagne1980.htm|access-date=2020-09-01|website=www.passionhockey.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is home to the [[Mannheim Tornados]], the oldest operational baseball and softball club in Germany. The Tornados play in the first division of the [[Bundesliga (baseball)|Baseball Bundesliga]] and have won the championship 11 times, more than any other club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tornados.de/modules/info/index.php?cat=2&amp;id=180]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mannheim hosted the [[European Show Jumping Championships]] in 1997, and the [[2007 FEI European Jumping Championship|FEI European Jumping Championships in 2007]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.em2007.de/ |title=FEI European Jumping Championship, Mannheim |publisher=Em2007.de |access-date=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718234211/http://www.em2007.de/ |archive-date=18 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 14–19 August, in the MVV-riding stadium.

In 2002, [[Hobby Horse Polo]] was invented in Mannheim, evoking the classical rivalry towards "polite society" in Heidelberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Express_23_06_2013_Steckenpferdpolo-001.jpg Express 23 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steckenpferdpolo.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Rheinpfalz_25_Juli_2008.jpg|title=Rheinpfalz July 25 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=holz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/steckenpferdpolo-trendsportart-in-duesseldorf-im-rheinpark-a-994129.html|title=Steckenpferdpolo: Trendsportart in Düsseldorf im Rheinpark|author=Eva Gerten, dpa|date=27 September 2014|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Block numbering and computer mapping==
The center of the city uses an addressing system unique within Germany. Rather than street names and numbers, each block is given a code and a number is given to each building, i.e. C3, 17 is block C3, building 17. This practice dates back centuries, and is a result of the original use of the city center as a fort, with the fort's internal system being adopted when it became public streets. The street themselves are unnamed. The codes are laid out in a simple progressive pattern, i.e. C3 is between C2 and C4 in one direction and B3 and D3 in the other, but those unused to the system will often become lost. A street named Breite Straße goes through the middle of the blocks from south to north, with blocks A-K on the west side of the street and L-U on the east, with each row going 1 to at most 7 based on distance from this road. House numbers begin on the south corner nearest Breite Straße and go counterclockwise for A-K and Clockwise for L-U.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twomonkeystravelgroup.com/7-awesome-things-mannheim-germany/|title=Mannheim, Germany - 7 Awesome Things To Do|website=twomonkeystravelgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This causes major issues with most mapping software, as the databases they use are based on the standard street-number system, and thus aren't able to accommodate a completely different system for a small area. A variety of fixes have been tried, none with a high level of success. In particular, these systems have issues because an address on a block can be on any of up to 4 roads, so attempts to fix the issue by giving the roads false names within the database have often failed to give accurate addressing, though such can still be seen on some platforms, like [[Google Maps]]. Finding an address in this area thus generally requires resorting to asking directions or using one of the many posted public maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSG-zxGRkJw|title=The European City Centre With No Street Names|last=Tom Scott|date=19 February 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original film, retroactively subtitled ''[[Star Wars (film)#Inclusion of subtitles|Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', was followed by the sequels ''[[Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980) and ''[[Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1983), forming the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. A [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]] was later released, consisting of ''[[Episode I: The Phantom Menace]]'' (1999), ''[[Episode II: Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002), and ''[[Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his [[Lucasfilm|production company]] to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. The subsequently produced [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]] consists of ''[[Episode VII: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015), ''[[Episode VIII: The Last Jedi]]'' (2017), and ''[[Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker]]'' (2019). Together, the three trilogies form what has been referred to as the "[[Skywalker saga]]". All nine films [[List of Star Wars films#Academy Awards|were nominated]] for [[Academy Awards]] (with wins going to the first two released) and were commercially successful. Together with the theatrical [[#Anthology films|spin-off films]] ''[[Rogue One]]'' (2016) and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story]]'' (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equates to over {{US$|10}}&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the-numbers.com/movies/series/StarWars.php|title=Star Wars – Box Office History|website=The Numbers|accessdate=January 5, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is currently the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|second-highest-grossing film franchise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Franchises|website=The Numbers|url=https://the-numbers.com/movies/series/franchisesW.php|accessdate=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mystical power known as [[the Force]] is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/6-great-quotes-about-the-force|title=6 Great Quotes About the Force|website=StarWars.com|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=November 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" are able to perform various [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] (such as [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]], [[precognition]], [[telepathy]], and manipulation of physical energy).&lt;ref name="star wars 5"&gt;{{Cite video|title =[[The Empire Strikes Back]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2004|medium=DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Force is wielded by two major [[Military order (religious society)|knightly orders]] at conflict with each other: the [[Jedi]], peacekeepers of the [[Galactic Republic]] who act on the light side of the Force through [[Detachment (philosophy)|non-attachment]] and [[arbitration]], and the [[Sith]], who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Christopher|title=Star Wars: I Am a Jedi|series=[[Little Golden Books]]|year=2016|others=Illustrated by Ron Cohee|pages=18–19|isbn=978-0736434874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the average population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called a [[lightsaber]], a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered [[Blaster (Star Wars)|blaster]] [[firearm]]s. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the [[Hutt (Star Wars)|Hutt]] cartel are dominant. [[Bounty hunter]]s are often employed by both [[gangsters]] and governments. Illicit activities include [[smuggling]] and [[slavery]].

According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films.&lt;ref name=kurtz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theforce.net/latestnews/story/gary_kurtz_reveals_original_plans_for_episodes_19_80270.asp|title=Gary Kurtz Reveals Original Plans for Episodes 1-9|website=TheForce.net|date=May 26, 1999|accessdate=September 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.jeditemplearchives.com/specialreports/banthatracks/archives/banthatracks08.pdf|magazine=Bantha Tracks|title=Interview: George Lucas|issue=8|year=1980|last=Lucas|first=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=494}} In 1983, Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."&lt;ref&gt;Worrell, Denise. ''Icons: Intimate Portraits''. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive."{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=303}} In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy.{{Sfn|Kaminski|2008|p=312}} A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "[[Changes in Star Wars re-releases|updated]]" the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.

''Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' was released on May 19, 1999, and ''Episode II: Attack of the Clones'' on May 16, 2002. ''Episode III: Revenge of the Sith'', the first {{nowrap|PG-13}} film in the franchise, was released on May 19, 2005.&lt;ref name="release dates"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415144223/http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/bts/production/news20040405.html|archivedate=April 15, 2008|title=Episode III Release Dates Announced|website=StarWars.com|date=April 5, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. The trilogy begins 32 years before ''Episode IV'' and follows the Jedi training of Anakin Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth Vader, as well as the corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gregory|last=Wakeman|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/new/George-Lucas-Was-Terrible-Predicting-Future-Star-Wars-68506.html|title=George Lucas Was Terrible At Predicting The Future Of Star Wars|date=December 4, 2014|website=CinemaBlend|accessdate=February 28, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthology films===
Lucasfilm and Kennedy have stated that the standalone films would be referred to as the ''Star Wars'' anthology series&lt;ref name="Entertainment Weekly"/&gt; (though the word ''anthology'' has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the promotional ''"A Star Wars Story"'' subtitle). Focused on how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, ''Rogue One'', was released on December 16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office success. The second, ''Solo'', centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25, 2018, to generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office. Despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released,&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/multiple-films-star-wars-pipeline-sources-56057987|title='Multiple films' still in 'Star Wars' pipeline, sources say|date=June 21, 2018|publisher=ABC|website=[[Good Morning America]]|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following a hiatus after 2019's ''The Rise of Skywalker''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/12/18307669/star-wars-episode-9-movies-series-hiatus|title=Star Wars movies to go on 'hiatus' after Episode IX|last=Patches|first=Matt|date=April 12, 2019|website=Polygon|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further animated series began to be released in the 2000s, the first two of which focused on the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. After Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm, only the later one remained canon. Three live-action ''Star Wars'' series will be released on [[Disney+]].

{{Main|Star Wars expanded to other media}}
From 1976 to 2014, the term ''Expanded Universe'' (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed ''Star Wars'' storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games.&lt;ref name="KurtzBourdaa2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W.L.

Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the ''Star Wars Legends'' label,&lt;ref name="KurtzBourdaa2016"/&gt; with downloadable content for the [[massively multiplayer online game]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic|The Old Republic]]'' the only ''Legends'' material to still be produced. The ''Star Wars'' canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|The Clone Wars]]'' (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page|website=StarWars.com|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple comics series from [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and novels published by [[Del Rey Books|Del Rey]] were produced after the announcement.

===Print media===
''Star Wars'' in print predates the release of the first film, with the December 1976 [[novelization]] of ''Star Wars'', initially subtitled "''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker|From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]''". Credited to Lucas, it was [[Ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by [[Alan Dean Foster]].&lt;ref name="Tor SW1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/2013/01/24/weird-differences-between-the-first-star-wars-movie-and-its-preceding-novelization/|title=Weird Differences Between the First ''Star Wars'' Movie and Its Preceding Novelization|first=Ryan|last=Britt|website=[[Tor.com]]|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619170336/http://www.tor.com/2013/01/24/weird-differences-between-the-first-star-wars-movie-and-its-preceding-novelization/|archivedate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first "Expanded Universe" story appeared in [[Marvel Comics]]' ''Star Wars'' #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster's sequel novel ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]'' the following month.

In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new ''Star Wars'' comic it had in development, which was picked up by [[Dark Horse Comics]] and published as the popular ''Dark Empire'' series (1991–1995).&lt;ref name="Dark Horse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-131/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed #131 |first= Brian |last= Cronin |date=November 29, 2007 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150426232903/http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/29/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-131 |archivedate= April 26, 2015 |url-status=live |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including ''[[Tales of the Jedi]]'' (1993–1998), ''[[Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron (comics)|X-wing Rogue Squadron]]'' (1995–1998), ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998–2006), ''[[Star Wars Tales]]'' (1999–2005), ''[[Star Wars: Empire]]'' (2002–2006), and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (comics)|Knights of the Old Republic]]'' (2006–2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-greatest-dark-horse-star-wars-comics-to-buy-before-1670419639|title=The Greatest Dark Horse ''Star Wars'' Comics To Buy Before They're Gone|first=James|last=Whitbrook|website=Gizmodo|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://denofgeek.com/us/books-comics/star-wars/231894/star-wars-the-13-greatest-dark-horse-comics-stories|title=''Star Wars'': The 13 Greatest Dark Horse Comics Stories|first=John|last=Saavedra|website=[[Den of Geek]]|date=January 4, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First announced as ''Project Luminous'' at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, full details of a publishing initiative called ''Star Wars: The High Republic'' were revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga will be explored in various books and comics. These include ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively, that will both premiere in August 2020.&lt;ref name="StarWarsHighRepublic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-the-high-republic|title=LUCASFILM TO LAUNCH STAR WARS: THE HIGH REPUBLIC PUBLISHING CAMPAIGN IN 2020|first=|last=|date=February 24, 2020|accessdate=February 25, 2020|publisher=StarWars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Audio novels====
{{Further|The Story of Star Wars|List of Star Wars books}}
The first ''Star Wars'' audio work is ''[[The Story of Star Wars]]'', an [[LP record|LP]] using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on [[cassette tape]] and re-released on [[Compact disc|CD]]. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Liptak |first1=Andrew |title=A new Star Wars audio-only novel will explore Count Dooku and Asajj Ventress' backstory |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284363/star-wars-audio-novel-dooku-asajj-ventress-backstory-lucasfilm |accessdate=5 October 2020 |work=The Verge |date=27 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Radio====
{{Further|Star Wars (radio)}}
Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated [[campus radio]] station of his alma mater the [[University of Southern California]], licensed the ''Star Wars'' radio rights to [[KUSC-FM]] for {{US$|1}}. The production used John Williams's original film score, along with [[Ben Burtt]]'s sound effects.&lt;ref name="Encyc Radio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Collect"/&gt;

The first was written by science-fiction author [[Brian Daley]] and directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]]. It was broadcast on [[NPR|National Public Radio]] in 1981, adapting [[Star Wars (radio)|the original 1977 film]] into 13 episodes.&lt;ref name="All Things"&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=Derek|title=That Time NPR Turned ''Star Wars'' Into A Radio Drama—And It Actually Worked|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/12/18/460269884/that-time-npr-turned-star-wars-into-a-radio-drama-and-it-actually-worked|publisher=[[NPR]] |website=[[All Things Considered]]|accessdate=March 2, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620103128/http://www.npr.org/2015/12/18/460269884/that-time-npr-turned-star-wars-into-a-radio-drama-and-it-actually-worked|archivedate=June 20, 2016 |url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyc Radio"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sterling |first=Christopher H. |title=Encyclopedia of Radio (Vol. 3) |publisher=Routledge |date=2004 |isbn=9781135456498 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UeveLMilioC&amp;pg=PA2206 |accessdate=March 2, 2017 |page=2206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Collect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.starwars.com/news/5-awesome-star-wars-media-collectibles |title=5 Awesome ''Star Wars'' Media Collectibles |website=StarWars.com |date=April 9, 2015 |accessdate=March 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Hamill]] and [[Anthony Daniels]] reprised their film roles.&lt;ref name="All Things"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyc Radio"/&gt;

===Video games===
{{Further|Star Wars video games|List of Star Wars video games}}
The ''Star Wars'' franchise has spawned over one hundred&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.igdb.com/2017/12/12/star-wars-40-years-in-gaming|title=Star Wars Infographic: 40 Years in Gaming |work=www.igdb.com |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest [[home consoles]]. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and removed from the canon in 2014). ''Star Wars'' games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to [[Electronic Arts]].

====Early licensed games (1979–1993)====
The first officially licensed electronic ''Star Wars'' game was [[Kenner Products|Kenner]]'s 1979 table-top ''Star Wars Electronic Battle Command''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldmuseum.com/Kenner/SWBattleCommand.htm |title=Kenner ''Star Wars'' Battle Command |publisher=Handheldmuseum.com |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coopee |first=Todd |title=''Star Wars'' Electronic Battle Command Game |url=https://toytales.ca/star-wars-electronic-battle-command-game/ |publisher=ToyTales.ca |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Parker Brothers]] published the first ''Star Wars'' video game for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1982 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogost |first1=Ian|authorlink1=Ian Bogost|last2=Montfort|first2=Nick|title=Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01257-7|title-link=Racing the Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed soon the year later by ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Arena]]'', the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by [[Atari]]'s [[rail shooter]] [[arcade game]] ''[[Star Wars (1983 video game)|Star Wars]]'', with [[vector graphics]] to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/7-30-a-brief-history-of-star-war-games-part-1.html|title=A Brief History of ''Star War'' Games, Part 1 (Slide 1–6) |date=May 20, 2007|publisher=[[Tom's Hardware]]|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next game, ''[[Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1984 video game)|Star Wars: Return of the Jedi]]'' (1984), has more traditional [[raster graphics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-return-of-the-jedi |title=''Star Wars: Return of the Jedi'' |publisher=[[MobyGames]] |accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the following ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1985 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1985) has vector graphics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=70 |pages=82–83 |title=The making of ''The Empire Strikes Back''|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platform game]]s were made for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], including the Japan-exclusive ''[[Star Wars (1987 video game)|Star Wars]]'' (1987), an international ''[[Star Wars (1991 video game)|Star Wars]]'' (1991), and ''[[Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1992 video game)|Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1992). ''[[Super Star Wars]]'' (1992) was released for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], with two sequels over the next two years.

====LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014)====
{{Main|LucasArts}}
Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games, and founded his own development company, [[LucasArts]]. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. In 1993, LucasArts released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.&lt;ref name="LA History 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lucasarts.com/20th/history_2.htm  |title=LucasArts Entertainment Company: 20th Anniversary (Part Two: The Classics, 1990–1994) |publisher=[[LucasArts]] |date=June 23, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025112/http://www.lucasarts.com/20th/history_2.htm |archivedate=June 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the best-selling video games of 1993 and established its own [[Star Wars: X-Wing (video game series)|series of games]].&lt;ref name="LA History 2"/&gt; The [[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (series)|''Rogue Squadron'' series]] was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.

''[[Star Wars: Dark Forces|Dark Forces]]'' (1995), a hybrid [[adventure game]] incorporating puzzles and strategy,&lt;ref name=PCG&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Mizell |first=Leslie |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |date=October 1994 |title=''Star Wars: Dark Forces'' preview | pages=34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first ''Star Wars'' [[first-person shooter]].&lt;ref name="Toms DF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tomshardware.com/picturestory/7-a-brief-history-of-star-war-games-part-1.html#s29|title=A Brief History of ''Star War'' Games, Part 1 (Slide 29–32) |date=May 20, 2007|publisher=Tom's Hardware|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts' custom-designed [[game engine]], the [[Jedi (game engine)|Jedi]].&lt;ref name="Toms DF"/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december03/doom/clones/index2.shtml|title=Bringin' in the ''DOOM'' Clones |last1=Turner|first1=Benjamin|last2=Bowen|first2=Kevin|date=December 11, 2003|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=August 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127062845/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/december03/doom/clones/index2.shtml|archivedate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Byte&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byte.com/art/9512/sec10/art1.htm|title=Today's hot first-person 3-D shoot-'em-ups |last=Baldazo|first=Rex|date=December 1995|website=[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]|accessdate=August 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123045145/http://www.byte.com/art/9512/sec10/art1.htm|archivedate=November 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was well received,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950319&amp;slug=2111023|title=Tech Reviews CD-Rom – Dark Forces|last=Kent|first=Steven L.|date=March 19, 1995|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GRDOS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/3397.asp?q=dark%20forces|title=''Star Wars Dark Forces'' – PC|publisher=[[GameRankings]]|accessdate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GspotDOS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/action/darkforces/review.html|title=''Star Wars Dark Forces'' Review |last=Dulin|first=Ron|date=May 1, 1996|website=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=October 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018150903/http://uk.gamespot.com/star-wars-dark-forces/reviews/dark-forces-review-2538507/|archivedate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was followed by [[Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)|four sequels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox.ign.com/articles/377/377807p1.html |last=Boulding |first=Aaron |title=''Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast'' Xbox review|date=November 19, 2002 |accessdate=March 3, 2017|website=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-knight-jedi-academy-designer-diary-1/1100-6073921/ | title=''Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy'' Designer Diary #1 | website=GameSpot| date=August 25, 2003| accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series introduced [[Kyle Katarn]], who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.stars.ign.com/articles/898/898223p1.html |title=Top 25 ''Star Wars Heroes'': Day 2 |last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |date=August 12, 2008 |website=IGN |accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katarn is a former [[stormtrooper (Star Wars)|stormtrooper]] who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi,&lt;ref name="Toms DF"/&gt;&lt;ref name=MG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/star-wars-dark-forces|title=''Star Wars: Dark Forces''|publisher=[[MobyGames]]|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SW Kyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/kylekatarn/|title=Katarn, Kyle|website=StarWars.com |accessdate=March 3, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912124400/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/kylekatarn/|archivedate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films.&lt;ref name="THR Jacen"/&gt; A [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]], ''[[Star Wars Galaxies]]'', was in operation from 2003 until 2011.

====''EA Star Wars'' (2014–present)====

The success of the ''Star Wars'' films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise's merchandising rights. By  1987, the first three films have made {{US$|2.6}}{{nbsp}}billion in merchandising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lPdVAAAAIBAJ&amp;q=convention+celebrates+star+wars+milestone&amp;pg=PA2|title=Convention celebrates 'Star Wars milestone|newspaper=[[The Register-Guard|Eugene Register-Guard]]|date=May 25, 1987|accessdate=December 21, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the first six films produced approximately {{US$|20}}{{nbsp}}billion in merchandising revenue.&lt;ref name=merch&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-lucas-star-wars-288513|title=The Real Force Behind 'Star Wars': How George Lucas Built an Empire|magazine=The Hollywood Reporter|date=February 9, 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenner made the first [[Kenner Star Wars action figures|''Star Wars'' action figures]] to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable.

[[Star Wars Trading Cards|''Star Wars'' Trading Cards]] have been published since the first "blue" series, by [[Topps]], in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 27, 2008|url=http://starwarscards.net/|title=Star Wars Trading Cards|website=Starwarscards.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare "promos", such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II "floating Yoda" P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most "base" or "common card" sets are plentiful, many "insert" or "[[Trading card|chase cards]]" are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 28, 2008|url= http://theswca.com/textf/promo.html | title = Star Wars Promotional Trading Card List |publisher=The Star Wars Collectors Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 until 2001, [[Decipher, Inc.]] had the license for, created, and produced the ''[[Star Wars Customizable Card Game]]''.

[[Political science]] has been an important element of ''Star Wars'' since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between [[democracy]] and [[dictatorship]].

In 1989, the [[Library of Congress]] selected the original ''Star Wars'' film for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]], as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."&lt;ref name=NFR-Titles&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. National Film Registry Titles |publisher=U.S. National Film Registry |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html |accessdate=September 2, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821132951/https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Unofficial/Movies/NFR-Titles.html |archivedate=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Empire Strikes Back'', was selected in 2010.&lt;ref name=congress&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jaseG0DbTvl6sIv1uPc-xelSmvjg?docId=c086d710fa42415cbeff1a6a2f80aa36|title='Empire Strikes Back' among 25 film registry picks|accessdate=December 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hollreporter&gt;{{cite news|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/empire-strikes-airplane-25-movies-65915|title='Empire Strikes Back,' 'Airplane!'

===Industry===
The original ''Star Wars'' film was a huge success for [[20th Century Fox]], and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37&amp;nbsp;million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/&gt; The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David A.|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-23265-5|edition=1st paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]], as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bigsby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigsby|first1=Christopher|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-84132-0|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Along with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0505080390may08,0,5905863,full.story |title=The power of the dark side |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=May 8, 2005 |accessdate=June 13, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062851/http://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-0505080390may08,0,5905863,full.story |archivedate=May 22, 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.&lt;ref name="msn"/&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote in his book ''[[The Great Movies]]'', "Like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''Star Wars'' was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after." It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, [[high-concept]] genre for filmmakers to build upon.&lt;ref name="Legacy" /&gt; Finally, along with [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', it shifted the film industry's focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbusters]] for younger audiences.&lt;ref name="EmpireOfDreams" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GreatEbert"&gt;{{cite web|work=Chicago Sun-Times|publisher=Sun-Times Media Group |last=Ebert |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |date=June 28, 1999 |title=Great Movies: Star Wars |url=https://rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-1977 |accessdate=October 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shone"&gt;[[Tom Shone|Shone, Tom]] (2004).

Some critics have blamed ''Star Wars'' and ''Jaws'' for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" films such as ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', and ''[[Annie Hall]]'' to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.&lt;ref name="American"&gt;{{cite web|work=Decent Films Guide |author=Greydanus, Steven D. |title=An American Mythology: Why Star Wars Still Matters |url=http://www.decentfilms.com/articles/starwars |accessdate=October 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such critic, [[Peter Biskind]], complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and [[New Hollywood]] films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age of movies]]... They marched backward through the looking-glass."&lt;ref name="American" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biskind"&gt;[[Peter Biskind|Biskind, Peter]] (1998). "Star Bucks". ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood''. New York: [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. pp. 336–337, 343. {{ISBN|0-684-80996-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In an opposing view, [[Tom Shone]] wrote that through ''Star Wars'' and ''Jaws'', Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth".&lt;ref name="Shone" /&gt;

The original ''Star Wars'' trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.&lt;ref&gt;For a sampling of the reviews, read the following:

====Fan works====
{{Main|Star Wars fan films}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing [[fan fiction]] to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts 'The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | publisher = [[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academia===
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource.  For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Hesterman |first= Sandra |journal= Australasian Journal of Early Childhood |issn= 1836-9391 |volume= 36 |issue= 4 |pages= 86–95 |title= Multiliterate Star Warians : the force of popular culture and ICT in early learning |date=December 1, 2011 |doi= 10.1177/183693911103600412|s2cid= 56078619 |url= https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/15743/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thompson |first= Stephanie |journal=Science Scope |location=Washington, D.C. |issn=0887-2376 |page=55 |title=The science of Star Wars: Integrating technology and the Benchmarks for Science Literacy |date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the US have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of [[psychopathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=Susan Hatters |last2=Hall |first2=Ryan C.
